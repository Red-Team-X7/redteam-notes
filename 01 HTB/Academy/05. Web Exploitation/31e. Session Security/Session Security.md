Maintaining and keeping track of a user's session is an integral part of web applications. It is an area that requires extensive testing to ensure it is set up robustly and securely. This module covers the most common attacks and vulnerabilities that can affect web application sessions, such as Session Hijacking, Session Fixation, Cross-Site Request Forgery, Cross-Site Scripting, and Open Redirects.

### Module Summary

Any inefficiencies or misconfigurations in the session-handling implementation of a web application, service, or API can have devastating consequences that range from information leakage and inadvertent user actions all the way to Account Takeover (ATO) and remote code execution.

As you can imagine, it is of paramount importance to thoroughly test the session-handling logic of a web application being assessed. That said, testing the robustness of a session-handling implementation is not a small feat. This is because chaining (seemingly unrelated) vulnerabilities is often required to successfully attack a user's session.

Worry not, though; in this module, we will provide you with a highly hands-on experience around attacking a user's session and the possible paths that you can take to achieve that.

In this module, you will have the opportunity to practice manual exploitation of the following:

-   Session Hijacking
-   Session Fixation
-   XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) <-- With a focus on user sessions
-   CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
-   Open Redirect <-- With a focus on user sessions

We will also discuss remediation guidance regarding the abovementioned vulnerabilities.

This module is broken into sections with accompanying hands-on exercises to practice each of the tactics and techniques we cover. The module ends with a practical hands-on skills assessment to gauge your understanding of the various topic areas.

You can start and stop the module at any time and pick up where you left off. There is no time limit or "grading," but you must complete all of the exercises and the skills assessment to receive the maximum number of cubes and have this module marked as complete in any paths you have chosen.

As you work through the module, you will see example commands and command output for the various topics introduced. It is worth reproducing as many of these examples as possible to reinforce further the concepts presented in each section. You can do this in the¬†`PwnBox`¬†provided in the interactive sections or your virtual machine.

The module is classified as "`Medium`" and assumes a working knowledge of the Linux command line and an understanding of information security fundamentals. The module also assumes basic knowledge of web applications and web requests, and it will build on this understanding to teach how session-related vulnerabilities can be exploited.

In addition to the above, a firm grasp of the following modules can be considered as prerequisites for the successful completion of this module:

-   Linux Fundamentals
-   Web Requests
-   Introduction to Web Applications
-   Using Web Proxies
-   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
