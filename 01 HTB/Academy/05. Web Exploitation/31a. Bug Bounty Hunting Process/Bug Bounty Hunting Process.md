Bug bounty programs encourage security researchers to identify bugs and submit vulnerability reports. Getting into the world of bug bounty hunting without any prior experience can be a daunting task, though. This module covers the bug bounty hunting process to help you start bug bounty hunting in an organized and well-structured way. It's all about effectiveness and professionally communicating your findings.

### Module Summary

We usually consider a bug bounty program a crowdsourcing initiative through which individuals can receive recognition and compensation for discovering and reporting software bugs. Bug bounty programs are more than that, though. A bug bounty program (also called a vulnerability rewards program) is essentially continuous and proactive security testing that supplements internal code audits and penetration tests and completes an organization's vulnerability management strategy.

Regardless of the perspective (own profit vs. organizational security), the focus and the true power of bug bounty programs lie on the bug bounty hunters' skills¬†`and`¬†professionalism.

Bug bounty programs are pretty formal and process-based. For a bug bounty hunter to be successful, they should be not only skilled but also aware of:

-   How a bug bounty program is structured
-   Bug/report submission and communication processes

This module will cover the entire bug bounty hunting process and how to document your findings properly.
