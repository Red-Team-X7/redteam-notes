Web services and APIs are frequently exposed to provide certain functionalities in a programmatic way between heterogeneous devices and software components. Both web services and APIs can assist in integrating different applications or facilitate separation within a given application. This module covers how to identify the functionality a web service or API offers and exploit any security-related inefficiencies.

### Module Summary

Security-related inefficiencies or misconfigurations in a web service or API can have devastating consequences that range from denial of service (DoS) and information leakage to remote code execution.

From a bug bounty hunter or web application penetration tester perspective, you must know how to assess the security of web services and APIs. That said, assessing the security of a web service or API is not a small feat. This is because web services and APIs can be affected by multiple vulnerability classes.

Worry not, though; in this module, we will provide you with a highly hands-on experience around attacking web services and APIs and the most common paths that you can take to achieve that.

Specifically, you will have the opportunity to practice manual exploitation of the following vulnerabilities against real-world web services and APIs.

-   Command Injection
-   SQL Injection
-   SSRF
-   LFI
-   XSS
-   Arbitrary File Upload
-   XXE
-   ReDOS
-   SOAP SQL Injection
-   SOAPAction Spoofing

This module is broken into sections with accompanying hands-on exercises to practice each of the tactics and techniques we cover. The module ends with a practical hands-on skills assessment to gauge your understanding of the various topic areas.

You can start and stop the module at any time and pick up where you left off. There is no time limit or "grading," but you must complete all of the exercises and the skills assessment to receive the maximum number of cubes and have this module marked as complete in any paths you have chosen.

As you work through the module, you will see example commands and command output for the various topics introduced. It is worth reproducing as many of these examples as possible to reinforce further the concepts presented in each section. You can do this in the¬†`PwnBox`¬†provided in the interactive sections or your virtual machine.

The module is classified as "`Medium`" and assumes a working knowledge of the Linux command line and an understanding of information security fundamentals. The module also assumes basic knowledge of web applications and web requests, and it will build on this understanding to teach how web service/API vulnerabilities can be exploited.

In addition to the above, a firm grasp of the following modules can be considered as prerequisites for the successful completion of this module:

-   Linux Fundamentals
-   Introduction to Python 3
-   Web Requests
-   Introduction to Web Applications
-   Using Web Proxies
-   File Inclusion / Directory Traversal
-   Attacking Web Applications with Ffuf
-   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
-   SQL Injection Fundamentals
-   SQLMap Essentials
-   File Upload Attacks
-   Command Injections
-   Server-side Attacks
-   Web Attacks
