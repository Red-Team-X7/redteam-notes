### Tools of the Trade

Many of the module sections require tools such as open-source scripts or precompiled binaries. Where applicable, these can be found in the `C:\Tools` directory on the Windows hosts provided in the sections aimed at attacking from Windows. In sections that focus on attacking AD from Linux we provide a Parrot Linux host customized for the target environment as if you were an anonymous user with an attack box within the internal network. All necessary tools and scripts will be preloaded on this host.  Here is a listing of many of the tools that we will cover in this module:
  
| Tool              | Description |  
| ----------------- | ----------- |

These tools can be used as replacements for various Windows `net*` commands and more. PowerView and SharpView can help us gather much of the data that BloodHound does, but it requires more work to make meaningful relationships among all of the data points. These tools are great for checking what additional access we may have with a new set of credentials, targeting specific users or computers, or finding some "quick wins" such as users that can be attacked via Kerberoasting or ASREPRoasting. |  
| [BloodHound](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound) | Used to visually map out AD relationships and help plan attack paths that may otherwise go unnoticed.

Active Directory (AD) is the leading enterprise domain management suite, providing identity and access management, centralized domain administration, authentication, and much more. Due to the many features and complexity of AD, it presents a large attack surface that is difficult to secure properly. To be successful as infosec professionals, we must understand AD architectures and how to secure our enterprise environments. As Penetration testers, having a firm grasp of what tools, techniques, and procedures are available to us for enumerating and attacking AD environments and commonly seen AD misconfigurations is a must.

### Module Summary

This module introduces AD enumeration and attack techniques in modern and legacy enterprise environments. We will cover core principles surrounding AD, Enumeration tools such as Bloodhound and Kerbrute, and attack TTPs such as taking advantage of SMB Null sessions, Password spraying, ACL attacks, attacking domain trusts, and more.

In this module, we will cover:

-   Foundational AD knowledge
-   AD enumeration principles
-   External Reconnaissance
-   Internal enumeration and footprinting
-   Lateral movement
-   Enumerating and Exploiting Trusts
-   Password spraying
-   LLNNR/NBT-NS Poisoning
-   Gaining privileged access
-   Using native tools to perform actions
-   Kerberoasting
-   Performing ACL Attacks
-   AD hardening principles

This module is broken down into sections with accompanying hands-on exercises to practice each of the tools, tactics, and techniques we cover. The module includes several guided and non-guided labs to reinforce the techniques covered throughout.

As you work through the module, you will see example commands and command output for the various topics introduced. It is worth reproducing as many examples as possible to reinforce further the concepts presented in each section. You can do this in the Pwnbox provided in the interactive sections or your virtual machine.

# Setting The Stage

## Introduction to Active Directory Enumeration & Attacks

* * * * *

### Active Directory Explained
--------------------------

`Active Directory` (`AD`) is a directory service for Windows enterprise environments that was officially implemented in 2000 with the release of Windows Server 2000 and has been incrementally improved upon with the release of each subsequent server OS since. AD is based on the protocols x.500 and LDAP that came before it and still utilizes these protocols in some form today. It is a distributed, hierarchical structure that allows for centralized management of an organization's resources, including users, computers, groups, network devices and file shares, group policies, devices, and trusts. AD provides `authentication, accounting, and authorization` functions within a Windows enterprise environment. If this is your first time learning about Active Directory or hearing these terms, check out the [Intro To Active Directory](https://academy.hackthebox.com/catalogue) module for a more in-depth look at the structure and function of AD, AD objects, etc.

* * * * *

### Why Should We Care About AD?
----------------------------

At the time of writing this module, Microsoft Active Directory holds around `43%` of the [market share](https://www.slintel.com/tech/identity-and-access-management/microsoft-active-directory-market-share#faqs) for enterprise organizations utilizing `Identity and Access management` solutions. This is a huge portion of the market, and it isn't likely to go anywhere any time soon since Microsoft is improving and blending implementations with Azure AD. Another interesting stat to consider is that just in the last two years, Microsoft has had over `2000` reported vulnerabilities tied to a [CVE](https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/26/Microsoft.html). AD's many services and main purpose of making information easy to find and access make it a bit of a behemoth to manage and correctly harden. This exposes enterprises to vulnerabilities and exploitation from simple misconfigurations of services and permissions. Tie these misconfigurations and ease of access with common user and OS vulnerabilities, and you have a perfect storm for an attacker to take advantage of. With all of this in mind, this module will explore some of these common issues and show us how to identify, enumerate, and take advantage of their existence. We will practice enumerating AD utilizing native tools and languages such as `Sysinternals`, `WMI`, `DNS`, and many others. Some attacks we will also practice include `Password spraying`, `Kerberoasting`, utilizing tools such as `Responder`, `Kerbrute`, `Bloodhound`, and much more.

We may often find ourselves in a network with no clear path to a foothold through a remote exploit such as a vulnerable application or service. Yet, we are within an Active Directory environment, which can lead to a foothold in many ways. The general goal of gaining a foothold in a client's AD environment is to `escalate privileges` by moving laterally or vertically throughout the network until we accomplish the intent of the assessment. The goal can vary from client to client. It may be accessing a specific host, user's email inbox, database, or just complete domain compromise and looking for every possible path to Domain Admin level access within the testing period. Many open-source tools are available to facilitate enumerating and attacking Active Directory. To be most effective, we must understand how to perform as much of this enumeration manually as possible. More importantly, we need to understand the "why" behind certain flaws and misconfigurations. This will make us more effective as attackers and equip us to give sound recommendations to our clients on the major issues within their environment, as well as clear and actionable remediation advice.

We need to be comfortable enumerating and attacking AD from both Windows and Linux, with a limited toolset or built-in Windows tools, also known as "`living off the land`." It is common to run into situations where our tools fail, are being blocked, or we are conducting an assessment where the client has us work from a `managed workstation` or `VDI instance` instead of the customized Linux or Windows attack host we may have grown accustomed to. To be effective in all situations, we must be able to adapt quickly on the fly, understand the many nuances of AD and know how to access them even when severely limited in our options.

* * * * *

### Real-World Examples
-------------------

Let's look at a few scenarios to see just what is possible in a real-world AD-centric engagement:

>Scenario 1 - Waiting On An Admin
>
>During this engagement, I compromised a single host and gained `SYSTEM` level access. Because this was a domain-joined host, I was able to use this access to enumerate the domain. I went through all of the standard enumeration, but did not find much. There were `Service Principal Names` (SPNs) present within the environment, and I was able to perform a Kerberoasting attack and retrieve TGS tickets for a few accounts. I attempted to crack these with Hashcat and some of my standard wordlists and rules, but was unsuccessful at first. I ended up leaving a cracking job running overnight with a very large wordlist combined with the [d3ad0ne](https://github.com/hashcat/hashcat/blob/master/rules/d3ad0ne.rule) rule that ships with Hashcat. The next morning I had a hit on one ticket and retrieved the cleartext password for a user account. This account did not give me significant access, but it did give me write access on certain file shares. I used this access to drop SCF files around the shares and left Responder going. After a while, I got a single hit, the `NetNTLMv2 hash` of a user. I checked through the BloodHound output and noticed that this user was actually a domain admin! Easy day from here.

* * * * *

>Scenario 2 - Spraying The Night Away
>
>Password spraying can be an extremely effective way to gain a foothold in a domain, but we must exercise great care not to lock out user accounts in the process. On one engagement, I found an SMB NULL session using the [enum4linux](https://github.com/CiscoCXSecurity/enum4linux) tool and retrieved both a listing of `all` users from the domain, and the domain `password policy`. Knowing the password policy was crucial because I could ensure that I was staying within the parameters to not lock out any accounts and also knew that the policy was a minimum eight-character password and password complexity was enforced (meaning that a user's password required 3/4 of special character, number, uppercase, or lower case number, i.e., Welcome1). I tried several common weak passwords such as Welcome1, `Password1`, Password123, `Spring2018`, etc. but did not get any hits. Finally, I made an attempt with `Spring@18` and got a hit! Using this account, I ran BloodHound and found several hosts where this user had local admin access. I noticed that a domain admin account had an active session on one of these hosts. I was able to use the Rubeus tool and extract the Kerberos TGT ticket for this domain user. From there, I was able to perform a `pass-the-ticket` attack and authenticate as this domain admin user. As a bonus, I was able to take over the trusting domain as well because the Domain Administrators group for the domain that I took over was a part of the Administrators group in the trusting domain via nested group membership, meaning I could use the same set of credentials to authenticate to the other domain with full administrative level access.

* * * * *

>Scenario 3 - Fighting In The Dark
>
>I had tried all of my standard ways to obtain a foothold on this third engagement, and nothing had worked. I decided that I would use the [Kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute) tool to attempt to enumerate valid usernames and then, if I found any, attempt a targeted password spraying attack since I did not know the password policy and didn't want to lock any accounts out. I used the [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) tool to first mashup potential usernames from the company's LinkedIn page. I combined this list with several username lists from the [statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) GitHub repo and, after using the `userenum` feature of Kerbrute, ended up with 516 valid users. I knew I had to tread carefully with password spraying, so I tried with the password `Welcome2021` and got a single hit! Using this account, I ran the Python version of BloodHound from my attack host and found that all domain users had RDP access to a single box. I logged into this host and used the PowerShell tool [DomainPasswordSpray](https://github.com/dafthack/DomainPasswordSpray) to spray again. I was more confident this time around because I could a) view the password policy and b) the DomainPasswordSpray tool will remove accounts close to lockout from the target list. Being that I was authenticated within the domain, I could now spray with all domain users, which gave me significantly more targets. I tried again with the common password Fall2021 and got several hits, all for users not in my initial wordlist. I checked the rights for each of these accounts and found that one was in the Help Desk group, which had [GenericAll](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-analysis/edges.html#genericall) rights over the [Enterprise Key Admins](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#enterprise-key-admins) group. The Enterprise Key Admins group had GenericAll privileges over a domain controller, so I added the account I controlled to this group, authenticated again, and inherited these privileges. Using these rights, I performed the [Shadow Credentials](https://posts.specterops.io/shadow-credentials-abusing-key-trust-account-mapping-for-takeover-8ee1a53566ab) attack and retrieved the NT hash for the domain controller machine account. With this NT hash, I was then able to perform a DCSync attack and retrieve the NTLM password hashes for all users in the domain because a domain controller can perform replication, which is required for DCSync.

* * * * *

### This Is The Way
---------------

These scenarios may seem overwhelming with many foreign concepts right now, but after completing this module, you will be familiar with most of them (some concepts described in these scenarios are outside the scope of this module). These show the importance of iterative enumeration, understanding our target, and adapting and thinking outside the box as we work our way through an environment. We will perform many of the parts of the attack chains described above in these module sections, and then you'll get to put your skills to the test by attacking two different AD environments at the end of this module and discovering your own attack chains. Strap in because this will be a fun, but bumpy, ride through the wild world that is `enumerating` and `attacking` Active Directory.

* * * * *

### Practical Examples
------------------

Throughout the module, we will cover examples with accompanying command output. Most of which can be reproduced on the target VMs that can be spawned within the relevant sections. You will be provided RDP credentials to interact with some of the target VMs to learn how to enumerate and attack from a Windows host (`MS01`) and SSH access to a preconfigured Parrot Linux host (`ATTACK01`) to perform enumeration and attack examples from Linux. You can connect from the Pwnbox or your own VM (after downloading a VPN key once a machine spawns) via RDP using [FreeRDP](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/wiki/CommandLineInterface), [Remmina](https://remmina.org/), or the RDP client of your choice where applicable or the SSH client built into the Pwnbox or your own VM.

* * * * *

#### Connecting via FreeRDP

We can connect via command line using the command:

	xfreerdp /v:<MS01 target IP> /u:htb-student /p:Academy_student_AD!

#### Connecting via SSH

We can connect to the provided Parrot Linux attack host using the command, then enter the provided password when prompted.

	ssh htb-student@<ATTACK01 target IP>

#### Xfreerdp to the ATTACK01 Parrot Host

We also installed an `XRDP` server on the `ATTACK01` host to provide GUI access to the Parrot attack host. This can be used to interact with the BloodHound GUI tool which we will cover later in this section. In sections where this host spawns (where you are given SSH access) you can also connect to it using `xfreerdp` using the same command as you would with the Windows attack host above:

	xfreerdp /v:<ATTACK01 target IP> /u:htb-student /p:HTB_@cademy_stdnt!

Most sections will provide credentials for the `htb-student` user on either `MS01` or `ATTACK01`. Depending on the material and challenges, some sections will have you authenticate to a target with a different user, and alternate credentials will be provided.

>Throughout the course of this module you will be presented with multiple mini Active Directory labs. Some of these labs can take 3-5 minutes to fully spawn and be accessible via RDP. We recommend scrolling to the end of each section, clicking to spawn the lab, and then start reading through the material, so the environment is up by the time you reach the interactive portions of the section.

* * * * *

### Toolkit
-------

We provide a Windows and Parrot Linux attack host in the accompanying lab for this module. All tools needed to perform all examples and solve all questions throughout the module sections are present on the hosts. The tools necessary for the Windows attack host, `MS01` are located in the `C:\Tools` directory. Others, such as the Active Directory PowerShell module, will load upon opening a PowerShell console window. Tools on the Linux attack host, `ATTACK01`, are either installed and added to the `htb-student` users' PATH or present in the `/opt` directory. You can, of course, (and it is encouraged) compile (where needed) and upload your own tools and scripts to the attack hosts to get in the habit of doing so or hosting them on an SMB share from the Pwnbox working with the tools that way. Keep in mind that when performing an actual penetration test in a client's network, it is always best to compile the tools yourself to examine the code beforehand and ensure there is nothing malicious hiding in the compiled executable. We don't want to bring infected tools into a client's network and expose them to an outside attack.

* * * * *

Have fun, and don't forget to think outside of the box! AD is immense. You will not master it overnight, but keep working at it, and soon the content in this module will be second nature.

## Scenario

* * * * *

We are junior penetration testers working for `CAT-5 Security`. After a few successful engagements shadowing with the team, the senior members want to see how well we can do starting an assessment on our own. The team lead sent us the following email detailing what we need to accomplish.

#### Tasking Email

![[scenario-email.png]]

This module will allow us to practice our skills (both prior and newly minted) with these tasks. The final assessment for this module is the execution of `two` internal penetration tests against the company Inlanefreight. During these assessments, we will work through an internal penetration test simulating starting from an external breach position and a second one beginning with an attack box inside the internal network as clients often request. Completing the skills assessments signifies the successful completion of the tasks mentioned in the scoping document and tasking email above. In doing so, we will demonstrate a firm grasp of many automated and manual AD attack and enumeration concepts, knowledge of and experience with a wide array of tools, and the ability to interpret data gathered from an AD environment to make critical decisions to advance the assessment. The content in this module is meant to cover core enumeration concepts necessary for anyone to be successful in performing internal penetration tests in Active Directory environments. We will also cover many of the most common attack techniques in great depth while working through some more advanced concepts as a primer for AD-focused material that will be covered in more advanced modules.

Below you will find a completed scoping document for the engagement containing all pertinent information provided by the customer.

* * * * *

### Assessment Scope
----------------

The following `IPs`, `hosts`, and `domains` defined below make up the scope of the assessment.

#### In Scope For Assessment

| Range/Domain | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` | Customer domain to include AD and web services. |
| `LOGISTICS.INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` | Customer subdomain |
| `FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL` | Subsidiary company owned by Inlanefreight. External forest trust with INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL |
| `172.16.5.0/23` | In-scope internal subnet. |
|  |  |

#### Out Of Scope

-   `Any other subdomains of INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL`
-   `Any subdomains of FREIGHTLOGISTICS.LOCAL`
-   `Any phishing or social engineering attacks`
-   `Any other IPS/domains/subdomains not explicitly mentioned`
-   `Any types of attacks against the real-world inlanefreight.com website outside of passive enumeration shown in this module`

* * * * *

### Methods Used
------------

The following methods are authorized for assessing Inlanefreight and its systems :

### External Information Gathering (Passive Checks)

External information gathering is authorized to demonstrate the risks associated with information that can be gathered about the company from the internet. To simulate a real-world attack, CAT-5 and its assessors will conduct external information gathering from an anonymous perspective on the internet with no information provided in advance regarding Inlanefreight outside of what is provided within this document.

Cat-5 will perform passive enumeration to uncover information that may help with internal testing. Testing will employ various degrees of information gathering from open-source resources to identify publicly accessible data that may pose a risk to Inlanefreight and assist with the internal penetration test. No active enumeration, port scans, or attacks will be performed against internet-facing "real-world" IP addresses or the website located at `https://www.inlanefreight.com`.

### Internal Testing

The internal assessment portion is designed to demonstrate the risks associated with vulnerabilities on internal hosts and services ( `Active Directory specifically`) by attempting to emulate attack vectors from within Inlanefreight's area of operations. The result will allow Inlanefreight to assess the risks of internal vulnerabilities and the potential impact of a successfully exploited vulnerability.

To simulate a real-world attack, Cat-5 will conduct the assessment from an untrusted insider perspective with no advance information outside of what's provided in this documentation and discovered from external testing. Testing will start from an anonymous position on the internal network with the goal of obtaining domain user credentials, enumerating the internal domain, gaining a foothold, and moving laterally and vertically to achieve compromise of all in-scope internal domains. Computer systems and network operations will not be intentionally interrupted during the test.

### Password Testing

Password files captured from Inlanefreight devices, or provided by the organization, may be loaded onto offline workstations for decryption and utilized to gain further access and accomplish the assessment goals. At no time will a captured password file or the decrypted passwords be revealed to persons not officially participating in the assessment. All data will be stored securely on Cat-5 owned and approved systems and retained for a period of time defined in the official contract between Cat-5 and Inlanefreight.

* * * * *

>We provided the above scoping documentation so we become used to seeing this style of documentation. As we progress through our Infosec Careers, especially on the offensive side, it will be common to receive scoping documents and Rules of Engagement (RoE) documents that outline these types of information.

* * * * *

### The Stage Is Set
----------------

Now that we have our scope clearly defined for this module, we can dive into exploring Active Directory enumeration and attack vectors. Now, let's dive into performing passive external enumeration against Inlanefreight.

# Initial Enumeration

## External Recon and Enumeration Principles

* * * * *

Before kicking off any pentest, it can be beneficial to perform `external reconnaissance` of your target. This can serve many different functions, such as:

-   Validating information provided to you in the scoping document from the client
-   Ensuring you are taking actions against the appropriate scope when working remotely
-   Looking for any information that is publicly accessible that can affect the outcome of your test, such as leaked credentials

Think of it like this; we are trying to get the `lay of the land` to ensure we provide the most comprehensive test possible for our customer. That also means identifying any potential information leaks and breach data out in the world. This can be as simple as gleaning a username format from the customer's main website or social media. We may also dive as deep as scanning GitHub repositories for credentials left in code pushes, hunting in documents for links to an intranet or remotely accessible sites, and just looking for any information that can key us in on how the enterprise environment is configured.

* * * * *

### What Are We Looking For?
------------------------

When conducting our external reconnaissance, there are several key items that we should be looking for. This information may not always be publicly accessible, but it would be prudent to see what is out there. If we get stuck during a penetration test, looking back at what could be obtained through passive recon can give us that nudge needed to move forward, such as password breach data that could be used to access a VPN or other externally facing service. The table below highlights the "`What`" in what we would be searching for during this phase of our engagement.

| Data Point | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `IP Space` | Valid ASN for our target, netblocks in use for the organization's public-facing infrastructure, cloud presence and the hosting providers, DNS record entries, etc. |
| `Domain Information` | Based on IP data, DNS, and site registrations. Who administers the domain? Are there any subdomains tied to our target? Are there any publicly accessible domain services present? (Mailservers, DNS, Websites, VPN portals, etc.) Can we determine what kind of defenses are in place? (SIEM, AV, IPS/IDS in use, etc.) |
| `Schema Format` | Can we discover the organization's email accounts, AD usernames, and even password policies? Anything that will give us information we can use to build a valid username list to test external-facing services for password spraying, credential stuffing, brute forcing, etc. |
| `Data Disclosures` | For data disclosures we will be looking for publicly accessible files ( .pdf, .ppt, .docx, .xlsx, etc. ) for any information that helps shed light on the target. For example, any published files that contain `intranet` site listings, user metadata, shares, or other critical software or hardware in the environment (credentials pushed to a public GitHub repo, the internal AD username format in the metadata of a PDF, for example.) |
| `Breach Data` | Any publicly released usernames, passwords, or other critical information that can help an attacker gain a foothold. |

We have addressed the `why` and `what` of external reconnaissance; let's dive into the `where` and `how`.

* * * * *

### Where Are We Looking?
---------------------

Our list of data points above can be gathered in many different ways. There are many different websites and tools that can provide us with some or all of the information above that we could use to obtain information vital to our assessment. The table below lists a few potential resources and examples that can be used.

| Resource | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| `ASN / IP registrars` | [IANA](https://www.iana.org/), [arin](https://www.arin.net/) for searching the Americas, [RIPE](https://www.ripe.net/) for searching in Europe, [BGP Toolkit](https://bgp.he.net/) |
| `Domain Registrars & DNS` | [Domaintools](https://www.domaintools.com/), [PTRArchive](http://ptrarchive.com/), [ICANN](https://lookup.icann.org/lookup), manual DNS record requests against the domain in question or against well known DNS servers, such as `8.8.8.8`. |
| `Social Media` | Searching Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook, your region's major social media sites, news articles, and any relevant info you can find about the organization. |
| `Public-Facing Company Websites` | Often, the public website for a corporation will have relevant info embedded. News articles, embedded documents, and the "About Us" and "Contact Us" pages can also be gold mines. |
| `Cloud & Dev Storage Spaces` | [GitHub](https://github.com/), [AWS S3 buckets & Azure Blog storage containers](https://grayhatwarfare.com/), [Google searches using "Dorks"](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database) |
| `Breach Data Sources` | [HaveIBeenPwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to determine if any corporate email accounts appear in public breach data, [Dehashed](https://www.dehashed.com/) to search for corporate emails with cleartext passwords or hashes we can try to crack offline. We can then try these passwords against any exposed login portals (Citrix, RDS, OWA, 0365, VPN, VMware Horizon, custom applications, etc.) that may use AD authentication. |

### Finding Address Spaces

![[bgp-toolkit.png]]

The `BGP-Toolkit` hosted by [Hurricane Electric](http://he.net/) is a fantastic resource for researching what address blocks are assigned to an organization and what ASN they reside within. Just punch in a domain or IP address, and the toolkit will search for any results it can. We can glean a lot from this info. Many large corporations will often self-host their infrastructure, and since they have such a large footprint, they will have their own ASN. This will typically not be the case for smaller organizations or fledgling companies. As you research, keep this in mind since smaller organizations will often host their websites and other infrastructure in someone else's space (Cloudflare, Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure, for example). Understanding where that infrastructure resides is extremely important for our testing. We have to ensure we are not interacting with infrastructure out of our scope. If we are not careful while pentesting against a smaller organization, we could end up inadvertently causing harm to another organization sharing that infrastructure. You have an agreement to test with the customer, not with others on the same server or with the provider. Questions around self-hosted or 3rd party managed infrastructure should be handled during the scoping process and be clearly listed in any scoping documents you receive.

In some cases, your client may need to get written approval from a third-party hosting provider before you can test. Others, such as AWS, have specific [guidelines](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/) for performing penetration tests and do not require prior approval for testing some of their services. Others, such as Oracle, ask you to submit a [Cloud Security Testing Notification](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/Security/Concepts/security_testing-policy_notification.htm). These types of steps should be handled by your company management, legal team, contracts team, etc. If you are in doubt, escalate before attacking any external-facing services you are unsure of during an assessment. It is our responsibility to ensure that we have explicit permission to attack any hosts (both internal and external), and stopping and clarifying the scope in writing never hurts.

### DNS

DNS is a great way to validate our scope and find out about reachable hosts the customer did not disclose in their scoping document. Sites like [domaintools](https://whois.domaintools.com/), and [viewdns.info](https://viewdns.info/) are great spots to start. We can get back many records and other data ranging from DNS resolution to testing for DNSSEC and if the site is accessible in more restricted countries. Sometimes we may find additional hosts out of scope, but look interesting. In that case, we could bring this list to our client to see if any of them should indeed be included in the scope. We may also find interesting subdomains that were not listed in the scoping documents, but reside on in-scope IP addresses and therefore are fair game.

#### Viewdns.info

![[viewdnsinfo.png]]

This is also a great way to validate some of the data found from our IP/ASN searches. Not all information about the domain found will be current, and running checks that can validate what we see is always good practice.

### Public Data

Social media can be a treasure trove of interesting data that can clue us in to how the organization is structured, what kind of equipment they operate, potential software and security implementations, their schema, and more. On top of that list are job-related sites like LinkedIn, Indeed.com, and Glassdoor. Simple job postings often reveal a lot about a company. For example, take a look at the job listing below. It's for a `SharePoint Administrator` and can key us in on many things. We can tell from the listing that the company has been using SharePoint for a while and has a mature program since they are talking about security programs, backup & disaster recovery, and more. What is interesting to us in this posting is that we can see the company likely uses SharePoint 2013 and SharePoint 2016. That means they may have upgraded in place, potentially leaving vulnerabilities in play that may not exist in newer versions. This also means we may run into different versions of SharePoint during our engagements.

### Sharepoint Admin Job Listing

![[spjob2.png]]

Don't discount public information such as job postings or social media. You can learn a lot about an organization just from what they post, and a well-intentioned post could disclose data relative to us as penetration testers.

Websites hosted by the organization are also great places to dig for information. We can gather contact emails, phone numbers, organizational charts, published documents, etc. These sites, specifically the embedded documents, can often have links to internal infrastructure or intranet sites that you would not otherwise know about. Checking any publicly accessible information for those types of details can be quick wins when trying to formulate a picture of the domain structure. With the growing use of sites such as GitHub, AWS cloud storage, and other web-hosted platforms, data can also be leaked unintentionally. For example, a dev working on a project may accidentally leave some credentials or notes hardcoded into a code release. If you know where to look for that data, it can give you an easy win. It could mean the difference between having to password spray and brute-force credentials for hours or days or gaining a quick foothold with developer credentials, which may also have elevated permissions. Tools like [Trufflehog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/truffleHog) and sites like [Greyhat Warfare](https://buckets.grayhatwarfare.com/) are fantastic resources for finding these breadcrumbs.

We have spent some time discussing external enumeration and recon of an organization, but this is just one piece of the puzzle. For a more detailed introduction to OSINT and external enumeration, check out the [Footprinting](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/footprinting) and [OSINT:Corporate Recon](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/osint-corporate-recon) modules.

Up to this point, we have been mostly passive in our discussions. As you move forward into the pentest, you will become more hands-on, validating the information you have found and probing the domain for more information. Let's take a minute to discuss enumeration principles and how we can put a process in place to perform these actions.

* * * * *

### Overarching Enumeration Principles
----------------------------------

Keeping in mind that our goal is to understand our target better, we are looking for every possible avenue we can find that will provide us with a potential route to the inside. Enumeration itself is an iterative process we will repeat several times throughout a penetration test. Besides the customer's scoping document, this is our primary source of information, so we want to ensure we are leaving no stone unturned. When starting our enumeration, we will first use `passive` resources, starting wide in scope and narrowing down. Once we exhaust our initial run of passive enumeration, we will need to examine the results and then move into our active enumeration phase.

* * * * *

### Example Enumeration Process
---------------------------

We have already covered quite a few concepts pertaining to enumeration. Let's start putting it all together. We will practice our enumeration tactics on the `inlanefreight.com` domain without performing any heavy scans (such as Nmap or vulnerability scans which are out of scope). We will start first by checking our Netblocks data and seeing what we can find.

#### Check for ASN/IP & Domain Data

![[BGPhe-inlane.png]]

From this first look, we have already gleaned some interesting info. BGP.he is reporting:

-   IP Address: 134.209.24.248
-   Mail Server: mail1.inlanefreight.com
-   Nameservers: NS1.inlanefreight.com & NS2.inlanefreight.com

For now, this is what we care about from its output. Inlanefreight is not a large corporation, so we didn't expect to find that it had its own ASN. Now let's validate some of this information.

#### Viewdns Results

![[viewdns-results.png]]

In the request above, we utilized `viewdns.info` to validate the IP address of our target. Both results match, which is a good sign. Now let's try another route to validate the two nameservers in our results.

	nslookup ns1.inlanefreight.com

```text
Server:		192.168.186.1
Address:	192.168.186.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	ns1.inlanefreight.com
Address: 178.128.39.165

nslookup ns2.inlanefreight.com
Server:		192.168.86.1
Address:	192.168.86.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:	ns2.inlanefreight.com
Address: 206.189.119.186 
```

We now have `two` new IP addresses to add to our list for validation and testing. Before taking any further action with them, ensure they are in-scope for your test. For our purposes, the actual IP addresses would not be in scope for scanning, but we could passively browse any websites to hunt for interesting data. For now, that is it with enumerating domain information from DNS. Let's take a look at the publicly available information.

Inlanefreight is a fictitious company that we are using for this module, so there is no real social media presence. However, we would check sites like LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook for helpful info if it were real. Instead, we will move on to examining the website `inlanefreight.com`.

The first check we ran was looking for any documents. Using `filetype:pdf inurl:inlanefreight.com` as a search, we are looking for PDFs.

#### Hunting For Files

![[google-dorks.png]]

One document popped up, so we need to ensure we note the document and its location and download a copy locally to dig through. It is always best to save files, screenshots, scan output, tool output, etc., as soon as we come across them or generate them. This helps us keep as comprehensive a record as possible and not risk forgetting where we saw something or losing critical data. Next, let's look for any email addresses we can find.

#### Hunting E-mail Addresses

![[intext-dork.png]]

Using the dork `intext:"@inlanefreight.com" inurl:inlanefreight.com`, we are looking for any instance that appears similar to the end of an email address on the website. One promising result came up with a contact page. When we look at the page (pictured below), we can see a large list of employees and contact info for them. This information can be helpful since we can determine that these people are at least most likely active and still working with the company.

#### E-mail Dork Results

Browsing the [contact page](https://www.inlanefreight.com/index.php/contact/), we can see several emails for staff in different offices around the globe. We now have an idea of their email naming convention (first.last) and where some people work in the organization. This could be handy in later password spraying attacks or if social engineering/phishing were part of our engagement scope.

![[ilfreightemails.png]]

#### Username Harvesting

We can use a tool such as [linkedin2username](https://github.com/initstring/linkedin2username) to scrape data from a company's LinkedIn page and create various mashups of usernames (flast, first.last, f.last, etc.) that can be added to our list of potential password spraying targets.

#### Credential Hunting

[Dehashed](http://dehashed.com/) is an excellent tool for hunting for cleartext credentials and password hashes in breach data. We can search either on the site or using a script that performs queries via the API. Typically we will find many old passwords for users that do not work on externally-facing portals that use AD auth (or internal), but we may get lucky! This is another tool that can be useful for creating a user list for external or internal password spraying.

Note: For our purposes, the sample data below is fictional.

	sudo python3 dehashed.py -q inlanefreight.local -p

```text

Now that we have a hang of this try your hand at searching for other results related to the inlanefreight.com domain. What can you find? Are there any other useful files, pages, or information embedded on the site? This section demonstrated the importance of thoroughly analyzing our target, provided that we stay in scope and do not test anything we are not authorized to and stay within the time constraints of the engagement. I have had quite a few assessments where I was having trouble gaining a foothold from an anonymous standpoint on the internal network and resorted to creating a wordlist using varying outside sources (Google, LinkedIn scraping, Dehashed, etc.) and then performed targeted internal password spraying to get valid credentials for a standard domain user account. As we will see in the following sections, we can perform the vast majority of our internal AD enumeration with just a set of low-privilege domain user credentials and even many attacks. The fun starts once we have a set of credentials. Let's move into internal enumeration and begin analyzing the internal `INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL` domain passively and actively per our assessment's scope and rules of engagement.

## Initial Enumeration of the Domain

We are at the very beginning of our AD-focused penetration test against Inlanefreight. We have done some basic information gathering and gotten a picture of what to expect from the customer via the scoping documents.

* * * * *

### Setting Up
----------

For this first portion of the test, we are starting on an attack host placed inside the network for us. This is one common way that a client might select for us to perform an internal penetration test. A list of the types of setups a client may choose for testing includes:

-   A penetration testing distro (typically Linux) as a virtual machine in their internal infrastructure that calls back to a jump host we control over VPN, and we can SSH into.
-   A physical device plugged into an ethernet port that calls back to us over VPN, and we can SSH into.
-   A physical presence at their office with our laptop plugged into an ethernet port.
-   A Linux VM in either Azure or AWS with access to the internal network that we can SSH into using public key authentication and our public IP address whitelisted.
-   VPN access into their internal network (a bit limiting because we will not be able to perform certain attacks such as LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning).
-   From a corporate laptop connected to the client's VPN.
-   On a managed workstation (typically Windows), physically sitting in their office with limited or no internet access or ability to pull in tools. They may also elect this option but give you full internet access, local admin, and put endpoint protection into monitor mode so you can pull in tools at will.
-   On a VDI (virtual desktop) accessed using Citrix or the like, with one of the configurations described for the managed workstation typically accessible over VPN either remotely or from a corporate laptop.

These are the most common setups I have seen, though a client may come up with another variation of one of these. The client may also choose from a "grey box" approach where they give us just a list of in-scope IP addresses/CIDR network ranges, or "black box" where we have to plug in and do all discovery blindly using various techniques. Finally, they can choose either evasive, non-evasive, or hybrid evasive (starting "quiet" and slowly getting louder to see what threshold we are detected at and then switching to non-evasive testing. They may also elect to have us start with no credentials or from the perspective of a standard domain user.

Our customer Inlanefreight has chosen the following approach because they are looking for as comprehensive an assessment as possible. At this time, their security program is not mature enough to benefit from any form of evasive testing or a "black box" approach.

-   A custom pentest VM within their internal network that calls back to our jump host, and we can SSH into it to perform testing.
-   They've also given us a Windows host that we can load tools onto if need be.
-   They've asked us to start from an unauthenticated standpoint but have also given us a standard domain user account (`htb-student`) which can be used to access the Windows attack host.
-   "Grey box" testing. They have given us the network range 172.16.5.0/23 and no other information about the network.
-   Non-evasive testing.

We have not been provided credentials or a detailed internal network map.

* * * * *

### Tasks
-----

Our tasks to accomplish for this section are:

-   Enumerate the internal network, identifying hosts, critical services, and potential avenues for a foothold.
-   This can include active and passive measures to identify users, hosts, and vulnerabilities we may be able to take advantage of to further our access.
-   Document any findings we come across for later use. Extremely important!

We will start from our Linux attack host without domain user credentials. It's a common thing to start a pentest off in this manner. Many organizations will wish to see what you can do from a blind perspective, such as this, before providing you with further information for the test. It gives a more realistic look at what potential avenues an adversary would have to use to infiltrate the domain. It can help them see what an attacker could do if they gain unauthorized access via the internet (i.e., a phishing attack), physical access to the building, wireless access from outside (if the wireless network touches the AD environment), or even a rogue employee. Depending on the success of this phase, the customer may provide us with access to a domain-joined host or a set of credentials for the network to expedite testing and allow us to cover as much ground as possible.

Below are some of the key data points that we should be looking for at this time and noting down into our notetaking tool of choice and saving scan/tool output to files whenever possible.

#### Key Data Points

| Data Point | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AD Users` | We are trying to enumerate valid user accounts we can target for password spraying. |
| `AD Joined Computers` | Key Computers include Domain Controllers, file servers, SQL servers, web servers, Exchange mail servers, database servers, etc. |
| `Key Services` | Kerberos, NetBIOS, LDAP, DNS |
| `Vulnerable Hosts and Services` | Anything that can be a quick win. ( a.k.a an easy host to exploit and gain a foothold) |

* * * * *

### TTPs
----

Enumerating an AD environment can be overwhelming if just approached without a plan. There is an abundance of data stored in AD, and it can take a long time to sift if not looked at in progressive stages, and we will likely miss things. We need to set a game plan for ourselves and tackle it piece by piece. Everyone works in slightly different ways, so as we gain more experience, we'll start to develop our own repeatable methodology that works best for us. Regardless of how we proceed, we typically start in the same place and look for the same data points. We will experiment with many tools in this section and subsequent ones. It is important to reproduce every example and even try to recreate examples with different tools to see how they work differently, learn their syntax, and find what approach works best for us.

We will start with `passive` identification of any hosts in the network, followed by `active` validation of the results to find out more about each host (what services are running, names, potential vulnerabilities, etc.). Once we know what hosts exist, we can proceed with probing those hosts, looking for any interesting data we can glean from them. After we have accomplished these tasks, we should stop and regroup and look at what info we have. At this time, we'll hopefully have a set of credentials or a user account to target for a foothold onto a domain-joined host or have the ability to begin credentialed enumeration from our Linux attack host.

Let's look at a few tools and techniques to help us with this enumeration.

### Identifying Hosts

First, let's take some time to listen to the network and see what's going on. We can use `Wireshark` and `TCPDump` to "put our ear to the wire" and see what hosts and types of network traffic we can capture. This is particularly helpful if the assessment approach is "black box." We notice some [ARP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) requests and replies, [MDNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_DNS), and other basic [layer two](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/multicast-l2/topics/topic-map/layer-2-understanding.html) packets (since we are on a switched network, we are limited to the current broadcast domain) some of which we can see below. This is a great start that gives us a few bits of information about the customer's network setup.

Scroll to the bottom, spawn the target, connect to the Linux attack host using `xfreerdp` and fire up Wireshark to begin capturing traffic.

#### Wireshark Output

![[ea-wireshark.png]]

-   ARP packets make us aware of the hosts: 172.16.5.5, 172.16.5.25 172.16.5.50, 172.16.5.100, and 172.16.5.125.

![[ea-wireshark-mdns.png]]

-   MDNS makes us aware of the ACADEMY-EA-WEB01 host.

If we are on a host without a GUI (which is typical), we can use [tcpdump](https://linux.die.net/man/8/tcpdump), [net-creds](https://github.com/DanMcInerney/net-creds), and [NetMiner](http://www.netminer.com/main/main-read.do), etc., to perform the same functions. We can also use tcpdump to save a capture to a .pcap file, transfer it to another host, and open it in Wireshark.

#### Tcpdump Output

	sudo tcpdump -i ens224 

![[tcpdump-example.png]]

There is no one right way to listen and capture network traffic. There are plenty of tools that can process network data. Wireshark and tcpdump are just a few of the easiest to use and most widely known. Depending on the host you are on, you may already have a network monitoring tool built-in, such as `pktmon.exe`, which was added to all editions of Windows 10. As a note for testing, it's always a good idea to save the PCAP traffic you capture. You can review it again later to look for more hints, and it makes for great additional information to include while writing your reports.

Our first look at network traffic pointed us to a couple of hosts via `MDNS` and `ARP`. Now let's utilize a tool called `Responder` to analyze network traffic and determine if anything else in the domain pops up.

[Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder-Windows) is a tool built to listen, analyze, and poison `LLMNR`, `NBT-NS`, and `MDNS` requests and responses. It has many more functions, but for now, all we are utilizing is the tool in its Analyze mode. This will passively listen to the network and not send any poisoned packets. We'll cover this tool more in-depth in later sections.

#### Starting Responder

	sudo responder -I ens224 -A 

#### Responder Results

![[responder-example.gif]]

As we start Responder with passive analysis mode enabled, we will see requests flow in our session. Notice below that we found a few unique hosts not previously mentioned in our Wireshark captures. It's worth noting these down as we are starting to build a nice target list of IPs and DNS hostnames.

Our passive checks have given us a few hosts to note down for a more in-depth enumeration. Now let's perform some active checks starting with a quick ICMP sweep of the subnet using `fping`.

[Fping](https://fping.org/) provides us with a similar capability as the standard ping application in that it utilizes ICMP requests and replies to reach out and interact with a host. Where fping shines is in its ability to issue ICMP packets against a list of multiple hosts at once and its scriptability. Also, it works in a round-robin fashion, querying hosts in a cyclical manner instead of waiting for multiple requests to a single host to return before moving on. These checks will help us determine if anything else is active on the internal network. ICMP is not a one-stop-shop, but it is an easy way to get an initial idea of what exists. Other open ports and active protocols may point to new hosts for later targeting. Let's see it in action.

#### FPing Active Checks

Here we'll start `fping` with a few flags: `a` to show targets that are alive, `s` to print stats at the end of the scan, `g` to generate a target list from the CIDR network, and `q` to not show per-target results.

	fping -asgq 172.16.5.0/23

```text
172.16.5.5
172.16.5.25
172.16.5.50
172.16.5.100
172.16.5.125
172.16.5.200
172.16.5.225
172.16.5.238
172.16.5.240

     510 targets
       9 alive
     501 unreachable
       0 unknown addresses

    2004 timeouts (waiting for response)
    2013 ICMP Echos sent
       9 ICMP Echo Replies received
    2004 other ICMP received

 0.029 ms (min round trip time)
 0.396 ms (avg round trip time)
 0.799 ms (max round trip time)
       15.366 sec (elapsed real time)
```

The command above validates which hosts are active in the `/23` network and does it quietly instead of spamming the terminal with results for each IP in the target list. We can combine the successful results and the information we gleaned from our passive checks into a list for a more detailed scan with Nmap. From the `fping` command, we can see 9 "live hosts," including our attack host.

>Note: Scan results in the target network will differ from the command output in this section due to the size of the lab network. It is still worth reproducing each example to practice how these tools work and note down every host that is live in this lab.

#### Nmap Scanning

Now that we have a list of active hosts within our network, we can enumerate those hosts further. We are looking to determine what services each host is running, identify critical hosts such as `Domain Controllers` and `web servers`, and identify potentially vulnerable hosts to probe later. With our focus on AD, after doing a broad sweep, it would be wise of us to focus on standard protocols typically seen accompanying AD services, such as DNS, SMB, LDAP, and Kerberos name a few. Below is a quick example of a simple Nmap scan.

	sudo nmap -v -A -iL hosts.txt -oN /home/htb-student/Documents/host-enum

The [-A (Aggressive scan options)](https://nmap.org/book/man-misc-options.html) scan will perform several functions. One of the most important is a quick enumeration of well-known ports to include web services, domain services, etc. For our hosts.txt file, some of our results from Responder and fping overlapped (we found the name and IP address), so to keep it simple, just the IP address was fed into hosts.txt for the scan.

```

We can see from the output above that we have a potential host running an outdated operating system ( Windows 7, 8, or Server 2008 based on the output). This is of interest to us since it means there are legacy operating systems running in this AD environment. It also means there is potential for older exploits like EternalBlue, MS08-067, and others to work and provide us with a SYSTEM level shell. As weird as it sounds to have hosts running legacy software or end-of-life operating systems, it is still common in large enterprise environments. You will often have some process or equipment such as a production line or the HVAC built on the older OS and has been in place for a long time. Taking equipment like that offline is costly and can hurt an organization, so legacy hosts are often left in place. They will likely try to build a hard outer shell of Firewalls, IDS/IPS, and other monitoring and protection solutions around those systems. If you can find your way into one, it is a big deal and can be a quick and easy foothold. Before exploiting legacy systems, however, we should alert our client and get their approval in writing in case an attack results in system instability or brings a service or the host down. They may prefer that we just observe, report, and move on without actively exploiting the system.

The results of these scans will clue us into where we will start looking for potential domain enumeration avenues, not just host scanning. We need to find our way to a domain user account. Looking at our results, we found several servers that host domain services ( DC01, MX01, WS01, etc.). Now that we know what exists and what services are running, we can poll those servers and attempt to enumerate users. Be sure to use the `-oA` flag as a best practice when performing Nmap scans. This will ensure that we have our scan results in several formats for logging purposes and formats that can be manipulated and fed into other tools.

We need to be aware of what scans we run and how they work. Some of the Nmap scripted scans run active vulnerability checks against a host that could cause system instability or take it offline, causing issues for the customer or worse. For example, running a large discovery scan against a network with devices such as sensors or logic controllers could potentially overload them and disrupt the customer's industrial equipment causing a loss of product or capability. Take the time to understand the scans you use before running them in a customer's environment.

We will most likely return to these results later for further enumeration, so don't forget about them. We need to find our way to a domain user account or `SYSTEM` level access on a domain-joined host so we can gain a foothold and start the real fun. Let's dive into finding a user account.

* * * * *

### Identifying Users
-----------------

If our client does not provide us with a user to start testing with (which is often the case), we will need to find a way to establish a foothold in the domain by either obtaining clear text credentials or an NTLM password hash for a user, a SYSTEM shell on a domain-joined host, or a shell in the context of a domain user account. Obtaining a valid user with credentials is critical in the early stages of an internal penetration test. This access (even at the lowest level) opens up many opportunities to perform enumeration and even attacks. Let's look at one way we can start gathering a list of valid users in a domain to use later in our assessment.

### Kerbrute - Internal AD Username Enumeration

[Kerbrute](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute) can be a stealthier option for domain account enumeration. It takes advantage of the fact that Kerberos pre-authentication failures often will not trigger logs or alerts. We will use Kerbrute in conjunction with the `jsmith.txt` or `jsmith2.txt` user lists from [Insidetrust](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames). This repository contains many different user lists that can be extremely useful when attempting to enumerate users when starting from an unauthenticated perspective. We can point Kerbrute at the DC we found earlier and feed it a wordlist. The tool is quick, and we will be provided with results letting us know if the accounts found are valid or not, which is a great starting point for launching attacks such as password spraying, which we will cover in-depth later in this module.

To get started with Kerbrute, we can download [precompiled binaries](https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute/releases/latest) for the tool for testing from Linux, Windows, and Mac, or we can compile it ourselves. This is generally the best practice for any tool we introduce into a client environment. To compile the binaries to use on the system of our choosing, we first clone the repo:

#### Cloning Kerbrute GitHub Repo

	sudo git clone https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute.git

Version: dev (9cfb81e) - 02/17/22 - Ronnie Flathers @ropnop

This tool is designed to assist in quickly bruteforcing valid Active Directory accounts through Kerberos Pre-Authentication.
It is designed to be used on an internal Windows domain with access to one of the Domain Controllers.
Warning: failed Kerberos Pre-Auth counts as a failed login and WILL lock out accounts

Usage:
  kerbrute [command]
  
  <SNIP>
```

We can add the tool to our PATH to make it easily accessible from anywhere on the host.

#### Adding the Tool to our Path

	echo $PATH

```text
/home/htb-student/.local/bin:/snap/bin:/usr/sandbox/:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games:/usr/share/games:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/snap/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/local/games:/usr/games:/home/htb-student/.dotnet/tools
```

#### Moving the Binary

	sudo mv kerbrute_linux_amd64 /usr/local/bin/kerbrute

We can now type `kerbrute` from any location on the system and will be able to access the tool. Feel free to follow along on your system and practice the above steps. Now let's run through an example of using the tool to gather an initial username list.

#### Enumerating Users with Kerbrute

	kerbrute userenum -d INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL --dc 172.16.5.5 jsmith.txt -o valid_ad_users

```text
2021/11/17 23:01:46 >  Using KDC(s):

2021/11/17 23:01:56 >  Done! Tested 48705 usernames (56 valid) in 9.940 seconds
```

We can see from our output that we validated 56 users in the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain and it took only a few seconds to do so. Now we can take these results and build a list for use in targeted password spraying attacks.

### Identifying Potential Vulnerabilities
-------------------------------------

The [local system](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localsystem-account) account `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM` is a built-in account in Windows operating systems. It has the highest level of access in the OS and is used to run most Windows services. It is also very common for third-party services to run in the context of this account by default. A `SYSTEM` account on a `domain-joined` host will be able to enumerate Active Directory by impersonating the computer account, which is essentially just another kind of user account. Having SYSTEM-level access within a domain environment is nearly equivalent to having a domain user account.

There are several ways to gain SYSTEM-level access on a host, including but not limited to:

-   Remote Windows exploits such as MS08-067, EternalBlue, or BlueKeep.
-   Abusing a service running in the context of the `SYSTEM account`, or abusing the service account `SeImpersonate` privileges using [Juicy Potato](https://github.com/ohpe/juicy-potato). This type of attack is possible on older Windows OS' but not always possible with Windows Server 2019.
-   Local privilege escalation flaws in Windows operating systems such as the Windows 10 Task Scheduler 0-day.
-   Gaining admin access on a domain-joined host with a local account and using Psexec to launch a SYSTEM cmd window

By gaining SYSTEM-level access on a domain-joined host, you will be able to perform actions such as, but not limited to:

-   Enumerate the domain using built-in tools or offensive tools such as BloodHound and PowerView.
-   Perform Kerberoasting / ASREPRoasting attacks within the same domain.
-   Run tools such as Inveigh to gather Net-NTLMv2 hashes or perform SMB relay attacks.
-   Perform token impersonation to hijack a privileged domain user account.
-   Carry out ACL attacks.

* * * * *

### A Word Of Caution
-----------------

Keep the scope and style of the test in mind when choosing a tool for use. If you are performing a non-evasive penetration test, with everything out in the open and the customer's staff knowing you are there, it doesn't typically matter how much noise you make. However, during an evasive penetration test, adversarial assessment, or red team engagement, you are trying to mimic a potential attacker's Tools, Tactics, and Procedures. With that in mind, `stealth` is of concern. Throwing Nmap at an entire network is not exactly quiet, and many of the tools we commonly use on a penetration test will trigger alarms for an educated and prepared SOC or Blue Teamer. Always be sure to clarify the goal of your assessment with the client in writing before it begins.

* * * * *

### Let's Find a User
-----------------

In the following few sections, we will hunt for a domain user account using techniques such as LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and password spraying. These attacks are great ways to gain a foothold but must be exercised with caution and an understanding of the tools and techniques. Now let's hunt down a user account so we can move on to the next phase of our assessment and start picking apart the domain piece by piece and digging deep for a multitude of misconfigurations and flaws.

#### Questions

>From your scans, what is the "commonName" of host 172.16.5.5 ?

>What host is running "Microsoft SQL Server 2019 15.00.2000.00"? (IP address, not Resolved name)

# Sniffing out a Foothold

## LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning - from Linux

* * * * *

At this point, we have completed our initial enumeration of the domain. We obtained some basic user and group information, enumerated hosts while looking for critical services and roles like a Domain Controller, and figured out some specifics such as the naming scheme used for the domain. In this phase, we will work through two different techniques side-by-side: network poisoning and password spraying. We will perform these actions with the goal of acquiring valid cleartext credentials for a domain user account, thereby granting us a foothold in the domain to begin the next phase of enumeration from a credentialed standpoint.

This section and the next will cover a common way to gather credentials and gain an initial foothold during an assessment: a Man-in-the-Middle attack on Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) and NetBIOS Name Service (NBT-NS) broadcasts. Depending on the network, this attack may provide low-privileged or administrative level password hashes that can be cracked offline or even cleartext credentials. Though not covered in this module, these hashes can also sometimes be used to perform an SMB Relay attack to authenticate to a host or multiple hosts in the domain with administrative privileges without having to crack the password hash offline. Let's dive in!

* * * * *

### LLMNR & NBT-NS Primer
---------------------

[Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4795) (LLMNR) and [NetBIOS Name Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc940063(v=technet.10)?redirectedfrom=MSDN) (NBT-NS) are Microsoft Windows components that serve as alternate methods of host identification that can be used when DNS fails. If a machine attempts to resolve a host but DNS resolution fails, typically, the machine will try to ask all other machines on the local network for the correct host address via LLMNR. LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System (DNS) format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts. It uses port `5355` over UDP natively. If LLMNR fails, the NBT-NS will be used. NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name. NBT-NS utilizes port `137` over UDP.

The kicker here is that when LLMNR/NBT-NS are used for name resolution, ANY host on the network can reply. This is where we come in with `Responder` to poison these requests. With network access, we can spoof an authoritative name resolution source ( in this case, a host that's supposed to belong in the network segment ) in the broadcast domain by responding to LLMNR and NBT-NS traffic as if they have an answer for the requesting host. This poisoning effort is done to get the victims to communicate with our system by pretending that our rogue system knows the location of the requested host. If the requested host requires name resolution or authentication actions, we can capture the NetNTLM hash and subject it to an offline brute force attack in an attempt to retrieve the cleartext password. The captured authentication request can also be relayed to access another host or used against a different protocol (such as LDAP) on the same host. LLMNR/NBNS spoofing combined with a lack of SMB signing can often lead to administrative access on hosts within a domain. SMB Relay attacks will be covered in a later module about Lateral Movement.

* * * * *

### Quick Example - LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning
--------------------------------------

Let's walk through a quick example of the attack flow at a very high level:

1.  A host attempts to connect to the print server at \\print01.inlanefreight.local, but accidentally types in \\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
2.  The DNS server responds, stating that this host is unknown.
3.  The host then broadcasts out to the entire local network asking if anyone knows the location of \\printer01.inlanefreight.local.
4.  The attacker (us with `Responder` running) responds to the host stating that it is the \\printer01.inlanefreight.local that the host is looking for.
5.  The host believes this reply and sends an authentication request to the attacker with a username and NTLMv2 password hash.
6.  This hash can then be cracked offline or used in an SMB Relay attack if the right conditions exist.

* * * * *

### TTPs
----

We are performing these actions to collect authentication information sent over the network in the form of NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 password hashes. As discussed in the [Introduction to Active Directory](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/introduction-to-active-directory) module, NTLMv1 and NTLMv2 are authentication protocols that utilize the LM or NT hash. We will then take the hash and attempt to crack them offline using tools such as [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/) or [John](https://www.openwall.com/john/) with the goal of obtaining the account's cleartext password to be used to gain an initial foothold or expand our access within the domain if we capture a password hash for an account with more privileges than an account that we currently possess.

Several tools can be used to attempt LLMNR & NBT-NS poisoning:

| Tool | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Responder](https://github.com/lgandx/Responder) | Responder is a purpose-built tool to poison LLMNR, NBT-NS, and MDNS, with many different functions. |
| [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh) | Inveigh is a cross-platform MITM platform that can be used for spoofing and poisoning attacks. |
| [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) | Metasploit has several built-in scanners and spoofing modules made to deal with poisoning attacks. |

This section and the following one will show examples of using Responder and Inveigh to capture password hashes and attempt to crack them offline. We commonly start an internal penetration test from an anonymous position on the client's internal network with a Linux attack host. Tools such as Responder are great for establishing a foothold that we can later expand upon through further enumeration and attacks. Responder is written in Python and typically used on a Linux attack host, though there is a .exe version that works on Windows. Inveigh is written in both C# and PowerShell (considered legacy). Both tools can be used to attack the following protocols:

-   LLMNR
-   DNS
-   MDNS
-   NBNS
-   DHCP
-   ICMP
-   HTTP
-   HTTPS
-   SMB
-   LDAP
-   WebDAV
-   Proxy Auth

Responder also has support for:

-   MSSQL
-   DCE-RPC
-   FTP, POP3, IMAP, and SMTP auth

* * * * *

### Responder In Action

Responder is a relatively straightforward tool, but is extremely powerful and has many different functions. In the `Initial Enumeration` section earlier, we utilized Responder in Analysis (passive) mode. This means it listened for any resolution requests, but did not answer them or send out poisoned packets. We were acting like a fly on the wall, just listening. Now, we will take things a step further and let Responder do what it does best. Let's look at some options available by typing `responder -h` into our console.

	responder -h

  -I eth0, --interface=eth0
                        Network interface to use, you can use 'ALL' as a

  -b, --basic           Return a Basic HTTP authentication. Default: NTLM
  -r, --wredir          Enable answers for netbios wredir suffix queries.
                        Answering to wredir will likely break stuff on the
                        network. Default: False
  -d, --NBTNSdomain     Enable answers for netbios domain suffix queries.
                        Answering to domain suffixes will likely break stuff
                        on the network. Default: False
  -f, --fingerprint     This option allows you to fingerprint a host that
                        issued an NBT-NS or LLMNR query.
  -w, --wpad            Start the WPAD rogue proxy server. Default value is
                        False
  -u UPSTREAM_PROXY, --upstream-proxy=UPSTREAM_PROXY
                        Upstream HTTP proxy used by the rogue WPAD Proxy for
                        outgoing requests (format: host:port)
  -F, --ForceWpadAuth   Force NTLM/Basic authentication on wpad.dat file
                        retrieval. This may cause a login prompt. Default:
                        False
  -P, --ProxyAuth       Force NTLM (transparently)/Basic (prompt)
                        authentication for the proxy. WPAD doesn't need to be
                        ON. This option is highly effective when combined with
                        -r. Default: False
  --lm                  Force LM hashing downgrade for Windows XP/2003 and
                        earlier. Default: False
  -v, --verbose         Increase verbosity.
```

As shown earlier in the module, the `-A` flag puts us into analyze mode, allowing us to see NBT-NS, BROWSER, and LLMNR requests in the environment without poisoning any responses. We must always supply either an interface or an IP. Some common options we'll typically want to use are `-wf`; this will start the WPAD rogue proxy server, while `-f` will attempt to fingerprint the remote host operating system and version. We can use the `-v` flag for increased verbosity if we are running into issues, but this will lead to a lot of additional data printed to the console. Other options such as `-F` and `-P` can be used to force NTLM or Basic authentication and force proxy authentication, but may cause a login prompt, so they should be used sparingly. The use of the `-w` flag utilizes the built-in WPAD proxy server. This can be highly effective, especially in large organizations, because it will capture all HTTP requests by any users that launch Internet Explorer if the browser has [Auto-detect settings](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/ie11-deploy-guide/auto-detect-settings-for-ie11) enabled.

With this configuration shown above, Responder will listen and answer any requests it sees on the wire. If you are successful and manage to capture a hash, Responder will print it out on screen and write it to a log file per host located in the `/usr/share/responder/logs` directory. Hashes are saved in the format `(MODULE_NAME)-(HASH_TYPE)-(CLIENT_IP).txt`, and one hash is printed to the console and stored in its associated log file unless `-v` mode is enabled. For example, a log file may look like `SMB-NTLMv2-SSP-172.16.5.25`. Hashes are also stored in a SQLite database that can be configured in the `Responder.conf` config file, typically located in `/usr/share/responder` unless we clone the Responder repo directly from GitHub.

We must run the tool with sudo privileges or as root and make sure the following ports are available on our attack host for it to function best:

```text
UDP 137, UDP 138, UDP 53, UDP/TCP 389,TCP 1433, UDP 1434, TCP 80, TCP 135, TCP 139, TCP 445, TCP 21, TCP 3141,TCP 25, TCP 110, TCP 587, TCP 3128, Multicast UDP 5355 and 5353
```

Any of the rogue servers (i.e., SMB) can be disabled in the `Responder.conf` file.

#### Responder Logs

	ls

```text
Analyzer-Session.log                Responder-Session.log
Config-Responder.log                SMB-NTLMv2-SSP-172.16.5.200.txt
HTTP-NTLMv2-172.16.5.200.txt        SMB-NTLMv2-SSP-172.16.5.25.txt
Poisoners-Session.log               SMB-NTLMv2-SSP-172.16.5.50.txt
Proxy-Auth-NTLMv2-172.16.5.200.txt
```

If Responder successfully captured hashes, as seen above, we can find the hashes associated with each host/protocol in their own text file. The animation below shows us an example of Responder running and capturing hashes on the network.

We can kick off a Responder session rather quickly:

#### Starting Responder with Default Settings

	sudo responder -I ens224 

#### Capturing with Responder

![[responder_hashes.png]]

Typically we should start Responder and let it run for a while in a tmux window while we perform other enumeration tasks to maximize the number of hashes that we can obtain. Once we are ready, we can pass these hashes to Hashcat using hash mode `5600` for NTLMv2 hashes that we typically obtain with Responder. We may at times obtain NTLMv1 hashes and other types of hashes and can consult the [Hashcat example hashes](https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes) page to identify them and find the proper hash mode. If we ever obtain a strange or unknown hash, this site is a great reference to help identify it. Check out the [Cracking Passwords With Hashcat](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/cracking-passwords-with-hashcat) module for an in-depth study of Hashcat's various modes and how to attack a wide variety of hash types.

Once we have enough, we need to get these hashes into a usable format for us right now. NetNTLMv2 hashes are very useful once cracked, but cannot be used for techniques such as pash-the-hash, meaning we have to attempt to crack them offline. We can do this with tools such as Hashcat and John.

Looking at the results above, we can see we cracked the NET-NTLMv2 hash for user `FOREND`, whose password is `Klmcargo2`. Lucky for us our target domain allows weak 8-character passwords. This hash type can be "slow" to crack even on a GPU cracking rig, so large and complex passwords may be more difficult or impossible to crack within a reasonable amount of time.

* * * * *

### Moving On
---------

At this point in our assessment, we have obtained and cracked one NetNTLMv2 hash for the user `FOREND`. We can use this as a foothold into the domain to begin further enumeration. It is best to collect as much data as possible during an assessment, so we should attempt to crack as many hashes as we can (provided our later enumeration shows the value in cracking them to further our access). We don't want to waste precious assessment time attempting to crack hashes for users that will not help us move further toward our goal. Before we move into other ways to obtain a foothold via password spraying, let's walk through a similar method for obtaining hashes from a Windows host using the Inveigh tool.

#### Questions

>Run Responder and obtain a hash for a user account that starts with the letter b. Submit the account name as you answer,

>Crack the hash for the previous account and submit the cleartext password as your answer.

>Run Responder and obtain an NTLMv2 hash for the user wley. Crack the hash using Hashcat and submit the user's password as your answer.

## LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning - from Windows
* * * * *

LLMNR & NBT-NS poisoning is possible from a Windows host as well. In the last section, we utilized Responder to capture hashes. This section will explore the tool [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh) and attempt to capture another set of credentials.

* * * * *

### Inveigh - Overview
------------------

If we end up with a Windows host as our attack box, our client provides us with a Windows box to test from, or we land on a Windows host as a local admin via another attack method and would like to look to further our access, the tool [Inveigh](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh) works similar to Responder, but is written in PowerShell and C#. Inveigh can listen to IPv4 and IPv6 and several other protocols, including `LLMNR`, DNS, `mDNS`, NBNS, `DHCPv6`, ICMPv6, `HTTP`, HTTPS, `SMB`, LDAP, `WebDAV`, and Proxy Auth. The tool is available in the `C:\Tools` directory on the provided Windows attack host.

We can get started with the PowerShell version as follows and then list all possible parameters. There is a [wiki](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh/wiki/Parameters) that lists all parameters and usage instructions.

Let's start Inveigh with LLMNR and NBNS spoofing, and output to the console and write to a file. We will leave the rest of the defaults, which can be seen [here](https://github.com/Kevin-Robertson/Inveigh#parameter-help).

We can see that we immediately begin getting LLMNR and mDNS requests. The below animation shows the tool in action.

### C# Inveigh (InveighZero)
------------------------

The PowerShell version of Inveigh is the original version and is no longer updated. The tool author maintains the C# version, which combines the original PoC C# code and a C# port of most of the code from the PowerShell version. Before we can use the C# version of the tool, we have to compile the executable. To save time, we have included a copy of both the PowerShell and compiled executable version of the tool in the `C:\Tools` folder on the target host in the lab, but it is worth walking through the exercise (and best practice) of compiling it yourself using Visual Studio.

Let's go ahead and run the C# version with the defaults and start capturing hashes.

```

As we can see, the tool starts and shows which options are enabled by default and which are not. The options with a `[+]` are default and enabled by default and the ones with a `[ ]` before them are disabled. The running console output also shows us which options are disabled and, therefore, responses are not being sent (mDNS in the above example). We can also see the message `Press ESC to enter/exit interactive console`, which is very useful while running the tool. The console gives us access to captured credentials/hashes, allows us to stop Inveigh, and more.

We can hit the `esc` key to enter the console while Inveigh is running.

### Remediation
-----------

Mitre ATT&CK lists this technique as [ID: T1557.001](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1557/001), `Adversary-in-the-Middle: LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay`.

There are a few ways to mitigate this attack. To ensure that these spoofing attacks are not possible, we can disable LLMNR and NBT-NS. As a word of caution, it is always worth slowly testing out a significant change like this to your environment carefully before rolling it out fully. As penetration testers, we can recommend these remediation steps, but should clearly communicate to our clients that they should test these changes heavily to ensure that disabling both protocols does not break anything in the network.

We can disable LLMNR in Group Policy by going to Computer Configuration --> Administrative Templates --> Network --> DNS Client and enabling "Turn OFF Multicast Name Resolution."

![[llmnr_disable.png]]

NBT-NS cannot be disabled via Group Policy but must be disabled locally on each host. We can do this by opening `Network and Sharing Center` under `Control Panel`, clicking on `Change adapter settings`, right-clicking on the adapter to view its properties, selecting `Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4)`, and clicking the `Properties` button, then clicking on `Advanced` and selecting the `WINS` tab and finally selecting `Disable NetBIOS over TCP/IP`.

![[disable_nbtns.png]]

While it is not possible to disable NBT-NS directly via GPO, we can create a PowerShell script under Computer Configuration --> Windows Settings --> Script (Startup/Shutdown) --> Startup with something like the following:

	$regkey = "HKLM:SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\NetBT\Parameters\Interfaces"
	Get-ChildItem $regkey |foreach { Set-ItemProperty -Path "$regkey\$($_.pschildname)" -Name NetbiosOptions -Value 2 -Verbose}

In the Local Group Policy Editor, we will need to double click on `Startup`, choose the `PowerShell Scripts` tab, and select "For this GPO, run scripts in the following order" to `Run Windows PowerShell scripts first`, and then click on `Add` and choose the script. For these changes to occur, we would have to either reboot the target system or restart the network adapter.

![[nbtns_gpo.png]]

To push this out to all hosts in a domain, we could create a GPO using `Group Policy Management` on the Domain Controller and host the script on the SYSVOL share in the scripts folder and then call it via its UNC path such as:

`\\inlanefreight.local\SYSVOL\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\scripts`

Once the GPO is applied to specific OUs and those hosts are restarted, the script will run at the next reboot and disable NBT-NS, provided that the script still exists on the SYSVOL share and is accessible by the host over the network.

![[nbtns_gpo_dc.png]]

Other mitigations include filtering network traffic to block LLMNR/NetBIOS traffic and enabling SMB Signing to prevent NTLM relay attacks. Network intrusion detection and prevention systems can also be used to mitigate this activity, while network segmentation can be used to isolate hosts that require LLMNR or NetBIOS enabled to operate correctly.

* * * * *

### Detection
---------

It is not always possible to disable LLMNR and NetBIOS, and therefore we need ways to detect this type of attack behavior. One way is to use the attack against the attackers by injecting LLMNR and NBT-NS requests for non-existent hosts across different subnets and alerting if any of the responses receive answers which would be indicative of an attacker spoofing name resolution responses. This [blog post](https://www.praetorian.com/blog/a-simple-and-effective-way-to-detect-broadcast-name-resolution-poisoning-bnrp/) explains this method more in-depth.

Furthermore, hosts can be monitored for traffic on ports UDP 5355 and 137, and event IDs [4697](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/auditing/event-4697) and [7045](https://www.manageengine.com/products/active-directory-audit/kb/system-events/event-id-7045.html) can be monitored for. Finally, we can monitor the registry key `HKLM\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\DNSClient` for changes to the `EnableMulticast` DWORD value. A value of `0` would mean that LLMNR is disabled.

* * * * *

### Moving On
---------

We've now captured hashes for several accounts. At this point in our assessment, we would want to perform enumeration using a tool such as BloodHound to determine whether any or all of these hashes are worth cracking. If we get lucky and crack a hash for a user account with some privileged access or rights, we can begin expanding our reach into the domain. We may even get very lucky and crack the hash for a Domain Admin user! If we were unlucky in cracking hashes or cracked some but did not yield any fruit, then perhaps password spraying (which we will cover in-depth in the following few sections) will be more successful.

# Sighting In, Hunting For A User

## Password Spraying Overview

* * * * *

Password spraying can result in gaining access to systems and potentially gaining a foothold on a target network. The attack involves attempting to log into an exposed service using one common password and a longer list of usernames or email addresses. The usernames and emails may have been gathered during the OSINT phase of the penetration test or our initial enumeration attempts. Remember that a penetration test is not static, but we are constantly iterating through several techniques and repeating processes as we uncover new data. Often we will be working in a team or executing multiple TTPs at once to utilize our time effectively. As we progress through our career, we will find that many of our tasks like scanning, attempting to crack hashes, and others take quite a bit of time. We need to make sure we are using our time effectively and creatively because most assessments are time-boxed. So while we have our poisoning attempts running, we can also utilize the info we have to attempt to gain access via Password Spraying. Now let's cover some of the considerations for Password spraying and how to make our target list from the information we have.

* * * * *

### Story Time
----------

Password spraying can be a very effective way to gain a foothold internally. There are many times that this technique has helped me land a foothold during my assessments. Keep in mind that these examples come from non-evasive "grey box" assessments where I had internal network access with a Linux VM and a list of in-scope IP ranges and nothing else.

#### Scenario 1

In this first example, I performed all my standard checks and could not find anything useful like an SMB NULL session or LDAP anonymous bind that could allow me to retrieve a list of valid users. So I decided to use the `Kerbrute` tool to build a target username list by enumerating valid domain users (a technique we will cover later in this section). To create this list, I took the `jsmith.txt` username list from the [statistically-likely-usernames](https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames) GitHub repo and combined this with results that I got from scraping LinkedIn. With this combined list in hand, I enumerated valid users with `Kerbrute` and then used the same tool to password spray with the common password `Welcome1`. I got two hits with this password for very low privileged users, but this gave me enough access within the domain to run BloodHound and eventually identify attack paths that led to domain compromise.

#### Scenario 2

In the second assessment, I was faced with a similar setup, but enumerating valid domain users with common username lists, and results from LinkedIn did not yield any results. I turned to Google and searched for PDFs published by the organization. My search generated many results, and I confirmed in the document properties of 4 of them that the internal username structure was in the format of `F9L8`, randomly generated GUIDs using just capital letters and numbers (`A-Z and 0-9`). This information was published with the document in the `Author` field and shows the importance of scrubbing document metadata before posting anything online. From here, a short Bash script could be used to generate 16,079,616 possible username combinations.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

for x in {{A..Z},{0..9}}{{A..Z},{0..9}}{{A..Z},{0..9}}{{A..Z},{0..9}}
    do echo $x;
done
```

I then used the generated username list with `Kerbrute` to enumerate every single user account in the domain. This attempt to make it more difficult to enumerate usernames ended up with me being able to enumerate every single account in the domain because of the predictable GUID in use combined with the PDF metadata I could locate and greatly facilitated the attack. Typically, I can only identify 40-60% of valid accounts using a list such as `jsmith.txt`. In this example, I significantly increased my chances of a successful password spraying attack by starting the attack with ALL domain accounts in my target list. From here, I obtained valid passwords for a few accounts. Eventually, I was able to follow a complicated attack chain involving [Resource-Based Constrained Delegation (RBCD)](https://posts.specterops.io/another-word-on-delegation-10bdbe3cd94a) and the [Shadow Credentials](https://www.fortalicesolutions.com/posts/shadow-credentials-workstation-takeover-edition) attack to ultimately gain control over the domain.

* * * * *

### Password Spraying Considerations
--------------------------------

While password spraying is useful for a penetration tester or red teamer, careless use may cause considerable harm, such as locking out hundreds of production accounts. One example is brute-forcing attempts to identify the password for an account using a long list of passwords. In contrast, password spraying is a more measured attack, utilizing very common passwords across multiple industries. The below table visualizes a password spray.

#### Password Spray Visualization

| Attack | Username | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | bob.smith@inlanefreight.local | Welcome1 |
| 1 | john.doe@inlanefreight.local | Welcome1 |
| 1 | jane.doe@inlanefreight.local | Welcome1 |
| DELAY |  |  |
| 2 | bob.smith@inlanefreight.local | Passw0rd |
| 2 | john.doe@inlanefreight.local | Passw0rd |
| 2 | jane.doe@inlanefreight.local | Passw0rd |
| DELAY |  |  |
| 3 | bob.smith@inlanefreight.local | Winter2022 |
| 3 | john.doe@inlanefreight.local | Winter2022 |
| 3 | jane.doe@inlanefreight.local | Winter2022 |

It involves sending fewer login requests per username and is less likely to lock out accounts than a brute force attack. However, password spraying still presents a risk of lockouts, so it is essential to introduce a delay between login attempts. Internal password spraying can be used to move laterally within a network, and the same considerations regarding account lockouts apply. However, it may be possible to obtain the domain password policy with internal access, significantly lowering this risk.

It's common to find a password policy that allows five bad attempts before locking out the account, with a 30-minute auto-unlock threshold. Some organizations configure more extended account lockout thresholds, even requiring an administrator to unlock the accounts manually. If you don't know the password policy, a good rule of thumb is to wait a few hours between attempts, which should be long enough for the account lockout threshold to reset. It is best to obtain the password policy before attempting the attack during an internal assessment, but this is not always possible. We can err on the side of caution and either choose to do just one targeted password spraying attempt using a weak/common password as a "hail mary" if all other options for a foothold or furthering access have been exhausted. Depending on the type of assessment, we can always ask the client to clarify the password policy. If we already have a foothold or were provided a user account as part of testing, we can enumerate the password policy in various ways. Let's practice this in the next section.

* * * * *

### Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - Credentialed
-----------------------------------------------------------

As stated in the previous section, we can pull the domain password policy in several ways, depending on how the domain is configured and whether or not we have valid domain credentials. With valid domain credentials, the password policy can also be obtained remotely using tools such as [CrackMapExec](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec) or `rpcclient`.

### Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - SMB NULL Sessions
----------------------------------------------------------------

Without credentials, we may be able to obtain the password policy via an SMB NULL session or LDAP anonymous bind. The first is via an SMB NULL session. SMB NULL sessions allow an unauthenticated attacker to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. SMB NULL session misconfigurations are often the result of legacy Domain Controllers being upgraded in place, ultimately bringing along insecure configurations, which existed by default in older versions of Windows Server.

When creating a domain in earlier versions of Windows Server, anonymous access was granted to certain shares, which allowed for domain enumeration. An SMB NULL session can be enumerated easily. For enumeration, we can use tools such as `enum4linux`, `CrackMapExec`, `rpcclient`, etc.

We can use [rpcclient](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/rpcclient.1.html) to check a Domain Controller for SMB NULL session access.

Once connected, we can issue an RPC command such as `querydominfo` to obtain information about the domain and confirm NULL session access.

#### Using rcpclient

	rpcclient -U "" -N 172.16.5.5

	querydominfo

```

We can also obtain the password policy. We can see that the password policy is relatively weak, allowing a minimum password of 7 characters.

Let's try this using [enum4linux](https://labs.portcullis.co.uk/tools/enum4linux). `enum4linux` is a tool built around the [Samba suite of tools](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/samba.7.html) `nmblookup`, `net`, `rpcclient` and `smbclient` to use for enumeration of windows hosts and domains. It can be found pre-installed on many different penetration testing distros, including Parrot Security Linux. Below we have an example output displaying information that can be provided by `enum4linux`.

### Enumerating the Password Policy - from Linux - LDAP Anonymous Bind
------------------------------------------------------------------

[LDAP anonymous binds](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/anonymous-ldap-operations-active-directory-disabled) allow unauthenticated attackers to retrieve information from the domain, such as a complete listing of users, groups, computers, user account attributes, and the domain password policy. This is a legacy configuration, and as of Windows Server 2003, only authenticated users are permitted to initiate LDAP requests. We still see this configuration from time to time as an admin may have needed to set up a particular application to allow anonymous binds and given out more than the intended amount of access, thereby giving unauthenticated users access to all objects in AD.

With an LDAP anonymous bind, we can use LDAP-specific enumeration tools such as `windapseach.py`, `ldapsearch`, `ad-ldapdomaindump.py`, etc., to pull the password policy. With [ldapsearch](https://linux.die.net/man/1/ldapsearch), it can be a bit cumbersome but doable. One example command to get the password policy is as follows:

#### Using ldapsearch

	ldapsearch -h 172.16.5.5 -x -b "DC=INLANEFREIGHT,DC=LOCAL" -s sub "*" | grep -m 1 -B 10 pwdHistoryLength

```text
forceLogoff: -9223372036854775808
lockoutDuration: -18000000000
lockOutObservationWindow: -18000000000
lockoutThreshold: 5
maxPwdAge: -9223372036854775808
minPwdAge: -864000000000
minPwdLength: 8
modifiedCountAtLastProm: 0
nextRid: 1002
pwdProperties: 1
pwdHistoryLength: 24
```

Here we can see the minimum password length of 8, lockout threshold of 5, and password complexity is set (`pwdProperties` set to `1`).

* * * * *

### Enumerating the Password Policy - from Windows
----------------------------------------------

If we can authenticate to the domain from a Windows host, we can use built-in Windows binaries such as `net.exe` to retrieve the password policy. We can also use various tools such as PowerView, CrackMapExec ported to Windows, SharpMapExec, SharpView, etc.

Using built-in commands is helpful if we land on a Windows system and cannot transfer tools to it, or we are positioned on a Windows system by the client, but have no way of getting tools onto it. One example using the built-in net.exe binary is:

#### Using net.exe

	net accounts

```text
Force user logoff how long after time expires?:       Never
Minimum password age (days):                          1
Maximum password age (days):                          Unlimited
Minimum password length:                              8
Length of password history maintained:                24
Lockout threshold:                                    5
Lockout duration (minutes):                           30
Lockout observation window (minutes):                 30
Computer role:                                        SERVER
The command completed successfully.
```

Here we can glean the following information:

-   Passwords never expire (Maximum password age set to Unlimited)
-   The minimum password length is 8 so weak passwords are likely in use
-   The lockout threshold is 5 wrong passwords
-   Accounts remained locked out for 30 minutes

This password policy is excellent for password spraying. The eight-character minimum means that we can try common weak passwords such as `Welcome1`. The lockout threshold of 5 means that we can attempt 2-3 (to be safe) sprays every 31 minutes without the risk of locking out any accounts. If an account has been locked out, it will automatically unlock (without manual intervention from an admin) after 30 minutes, but we should avoid locking out `ANY` accounts at all costs.

PowerView is also quite handy for this:

#### Using PowerView

	import-module .\PowerView.ps1
	Get-DomainPolicy

```text
Unicode        : @{Unicode=yes}
SystemAccess   : @{MinimumPasswordAge=1; MaximumPasswordAge=-1; MinimumPasswordLength=8; PasswordComplexity=1;
                 PasswordHistorySize=24; LockoutBadCount=5; ResetLockoutCount=30; LockoutDuration=30;
                 RequireLogonToChangePassword=0; ForceLogoffWhenHourExpire=0; ClearTextPassword=0;
                 LSAAnonymousNameLookup=0}
KerberosPolicy : @{MaxTicketAge=10; MaxRenewAge=7; MaxServiceAge=600; MaxClockSkew=5; TicketValidateClient=1}
Version        : @{signature="$CHICAGO$"; Revision=1}
RegistryValues : @{MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\NoLMHash=System.Object[]}
Path           : \\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\sysvol\INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL\Policies\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\MACHI
                 NE\Microsoft\Windows NT\SecEdit\GptTmpl.inf
GPOName        : {31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}
GPODisplayName : Default Domain Policy
```

PowerView gave us the same output as our `net accounts` command, just in a different format but also revealed that password complexity is enabled (`PasswordComplexity=1`).

As with Linux, we have many tools at our disposal to retrieve the password policy while on a Windows system, whether it is our attack system or a system provided by the client. PowerView/SharpView are always good bets, as are CrackMapExec, SharpMapExec, and others. The choice of tools depends on the goal of the assessment, stealth considerations, any anti-virus or EDR in place, and other potential restrictions on the target host. Let's cover a few examples.

* * * * *

### Analyzing the Password Policy
-----------------------------

We've now pulled the password policy in numerous ways. Let's go through the policy for the INLANEFREIGHT.LOCAL domain piece by piece.

-   The minimum password length is 8 (8 is very common, but nowadays, we are seeing more and more organizations enforce a 10-14 character password, which can remove some password options for us, but does not mitigate the password spraying vector completely)
-   The account lockout threshold is 5 (it is not uncommon to see a lower threshold such as 3 or even no lockout threshold set at all)
-   The lockout duration is 30 minutes (this may be higher or lower depending on the organization), so if we do accidentally lockout (avoid!!) an account, it will unlock after the 30-minute window passes
-   Accounts unlock automatically (in some organizations, an admin must manually unlock the account). We never want to lockout accounts while performing password spraying, but we especially want to avoid locking out accounts in an organization where an admin would have to intervene and unlock hundreds (or thousands) of accounts by hand/script
-   Password complexity is enabled, meaning that a user must choose a password with 3/4 of the following: an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, special character (`Password1` or `Welcome1` would satisfy the "complexity" requirement here, but are still clearly weak passwords).

The default password policy when a new domain is created is as follows, and there have been plenty of organizations that never changed this policy:

| Policy | Default Value |
| --- | --- |
| Enforce password history | 24 days |
| Maximum password age | 42 days |
| Minimum password age | 1 day |
| Minimum password length | 7 |
| Password must meet complexity requirements | Enabled |
| Store passwords using reversible encryption | Disabled |
| Account lockout duration | Not set |
| Account lockout threshold | 0 |
| Reset account lockout counter after | Not set |

* * * * *

### Next Steps
----------

Now that we have the password policy in hand, we need to create a target user list to perform our password spraying attack. Remember that sometimes we will not be able to obtain the password policy if we are performing external password spraying (or if we are on an internal assessment and cannot retrieve the policy using any of the methods shown here). In these cases, we `MUST` exercise extreme caution not to lock out accounts. We can always ask our client for their password policy if the goal is as comprehensive an assessment as possible. If asking for the policy does not fit the expectations of the assessment or the client does not want to provide it, we should run one, max two, password spraying attempts (regardless of whether we are internal or external) and wait over an hour between attempts if we indeed decide to attempt two. While most organizations will have a lockout threshold of 5 bad password attempts, a lockout duration of 30 minutes and accounts will automatically unlock, we cannot always count on this being normal. I have seen plenty of organizations with a lockout threshold of 3, requiring an admin to intervene and unlock accounts manually.

`We do not want to be the pentester that locks out every account in the organization!`

Let's now prepare to launch our password spraying attacks by gathering a list of target users.
