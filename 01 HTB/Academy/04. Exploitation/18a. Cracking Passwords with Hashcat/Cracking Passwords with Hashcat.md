This module covers the fundamentals of password cracking using the Hashcat tool.

### Cheatsheet

| **Command** | **Description** |
| --------------|-------------------|
|¬†`pip install hashid` | Install the `hashid` tool |
| `hashid <hash>` OR `hashid <hashes.txt>` | Identify a hash with the `hashid` tool |
| `hashcat --example-hashes` | View a list of `Hashcat` hash modes and example hashes |
| `hashcat -b -m <hash mode>` | Perform a `Hashcat` benchmark test of a specific hash mode |
| `hashcat -b` | Perform a benchmark of all hash modes |
| `hashcat -O` | Optimization: Increase speed but limit potential password length |
| `hashcat -w 3` | Optimization: Use when Hashcat is the only thing running, use 1 if running hashcat on your desktop.  Default is 2 |
| `hashcat -a 0 -m <hash type> <hash file> <wordlist>` | Dictionary attack |
| `hashcat -a 1 -m <hash type> <hash file> <wordlist1> <wordlist2>` | Combination attack |
| `hashcat -a 3 -m 0 <hash file> -1 01 'ILFREIGHT?l?l?l?l?l20?1?d'` | Sample Mask attack |
| `hashcat -a 7 -m 0 <hash file> -1=01 '20?1?d' rockyou.txt` | Sample Hybrid attack |
| `crunch <minimum length> <maximum length> <charset> -t <pattern> -o <output file>` | Make a wordlist with `Crunch` |
| `python3 cupp.py -i` | Use `CUPP` interactive mode |
| `kwp -s 1 basechars/full.base keymaps/en-us.keymap  routes/2-to-10-max-3-direction-changes.route` | `Kwprocessor` example |
| `cewl -d <depth to spider> -m <minimum word length> -w <output wordlist> <url of website>` | Sample `CeWL` command |
| `hashcat -a 0 -m 100 hash rockyou.txt -r rule.txt` | Sample `Hashcat` rule syntax |
| `./cap2hccapx.bin input.cap output.hccapx` | `cap2hccapx` syntax |
| `hcxpcaptool -z pmkidhash_corp cracking_pmkid.cap ` | `hcxpcaptool`syntax |

### Module Summary

This module introduces the fundamentals of password cracking, with a focus on using¬†`Hashcat`¬†effectively. During security assessments, we often run into times when we need to perform offline password cracking for everything from the password hash of a password-protected document to password hashes in a database dump retrieved from a SQL Injection attack or a variety of different hash types retrieved during the course of a penetration test of an Active Directory environment. Cracking a password hash may be necessary for furthering access during an assessment or demonstrating to a client that their password policy needs to be enhanced by cracking password hashes and reporting on metrics such as password complexity and password re-use. In this module, we will cover:

-   An intro to password cracking
-   An overview of¬†`Hashcat`
-   `Hashcat`¬†attack types
-   Cracking common hashes
-   Creating custom wordlists
-   Using¬†`Hashcat`¬†rule sets
-   Using¬†`Hashcat`¬†masks

This module is broken down into sections with accompanying hands-on exercises to practice each of the tactics and techniques we cover. The module ends with a practical hands-on skills assessment to gauge your understanding of the various topic areas.

As you work through the module, you will see example commands and command output for the various topics introduced. It is worth reproducing as many of these examples as possible to reinforce further the concepts introduced in each section. You can do this in the Pwnbox provided in the interactive sections or your own virtual machine.

You can start and stop the module at any time and pick up where you left off. There is no time limit or "grading," but you must complete all of the exercises and the skills assessment to receive the maximum number of cubes and have this module marked as complete in any paths you have chosen.

The module is classified as "Medium" but assumes a working knowledge of the Linux command line and an understanding of information security fundamentals.

A firm grasp of the following modules can be considered prerequisites for successful completion of this module:

-   Introduction to Networking
-   Linux Fundamentals
