# Description

On a path to avenging his father, Tex Chance manufactured steam-powered robots to capture all the animals of your island to build a powerful army of fused mutated organisms using his powerful Sigma technology. You can't let them take away your loyal doggo Julius. The robots have been trained to classify all the objects they encounter using the SigmaNet network. Can you use your laser pointer to change some of the robot's vision pixels forcing it to misclassify your dog's image?
