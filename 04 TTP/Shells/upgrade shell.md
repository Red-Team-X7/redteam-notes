## Description

Often during pen tests you may obtain a shell without having tty, yet wish to interact further with the system. Here are some commands which will allow you to spawn a tty shell. Obviously some of this will depend on the system environment and installed packages. 

## Usage Examples

```shell-session
-   python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'
-   echo os.system('/bin/bash')
-   /bin/sh -i
-   perl â€”e 'exec "/bin/sh";'
-   perl: exec "/bin/sh";
-   ruby: exec "/bin/sh"
-   lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')
-   (From within IRB): exec "/bin/sh"
-   (From within vi) :!bash
-   (From within vi) :set shell=/bin/bash:shell
-   (From within nmap) !sh
```
