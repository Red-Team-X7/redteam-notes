## Description

## Cheatsheet

| **Command** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| `msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ipmi/ipmi_version)` | IPMI version detection. |
| `msf6 auxiliary(scanner/ipmi/ipmi_dumphashes)` | Dump IPMI hashes. |

#### Default Passwords

| Product | Username | Password |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dell iDRAC | root | calvin |
| HP iLO | Administrator | randomized 8-character string consisting of numbers and uppercase letters |
| Supermicro IPMI | ADMIN | ADMIN |

#### Dangerous Settings

If default credentials do not work to access a BMC, we can turn to a [flaw](http://fish2.com/ipmi/remote-pw-cracking.html) in the RAKP protocol in IPMI 2.0. During the authentication process, the server sends a salted SHA1 or MD5 hash of the user's password to the client before authentication takes place. This can be leveraged to obtain the password hash for ANY valid user account on the BMC. These password hashes can then be cracked offline using a dictionary attack using `Hashcat` mode `7300`. In the event of an HP iLO using a factory default password, we can use this Hashcat mask attack command `hashcat -m 7300 ipmi.txt -a 3 ?1?1?1?1?1?1?1?1 -1 ?d?u` which tries all combinations of upper case letters and numbers for an eight-character password.

There is no direct "fix" to this issue because the flaw is a critical component of the IPMI specification. Clients can opt for very long, difficult to crack passwords or implement network segmentation rules to restrict the direct access to the BMCs. It is important to not overlook IPMI during internal penetration tests (we see it during most assessments) because not only can we often gain access to the BMC web console, which is a high-risk finding, but we have seen environments where a unique (but crackable) password is set that is later re-used across other systems. On one such penetration test, we obtained an IPMI hash, cracked it offline using Hashcat, and were able to SSH into many critical servers in the environment as the root user and gain access to web management consoles for various network monitoring tools.

## Usage Examples

### nmap

	sudo nmap -sU --script ipmi-version -p 623 ilo.inlanfreight.local
