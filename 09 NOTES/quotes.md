```shell-session
If I had the Thanos glove I wouldn’t use it to impose my personal ideology on the world, I’d use it to **make all the secrets of the powerful visible to everyone** and democratize information sharing so people could decide for themselves what course of action to take in response. All government secrets, all corporate and financial secrets, all the secrets of media institutions, would all be immediately visible and placed in front of everyone’s eyes. Then everyone gets a device with access to a global public forum to talk about everything they’ve learned.
