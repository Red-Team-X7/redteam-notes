## Description

This course is based on a Youtube series called the Web Security Academy Series. This series aims to be a one stop course for not only learning how to hack web applications, but also learning how to automate your exploits using Python3 and gaining an understanding of how to mitigate vulnerabilities to defend web applications against real world attacks!

The course uses a mixture of both theory and practice. The theory component covers the background knowledge that is required in order to gain an advanced understanding of the technical details behind a specific vulnerability class. The practical component makes use of PortSwigger's Web Security Academy labs to get real world hands on experience in hacking applications. As can be seen in the course curriculum, we aim for in depth advanced understanding of each vulnerability class. The SQL Injection module alone is over 9 hours long! The course will be constantly updated until all modules in the Web Security Academy are completed.
