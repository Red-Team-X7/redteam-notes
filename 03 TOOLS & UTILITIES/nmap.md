## Description

Nmap (‚ÄúNetwork Mapper‚Äù) is a free and open source (license) utility for network discovery and security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping).

Nmap was named ‚ÄúSecurity Product of the Year‚Äù by Linux Journal, Info World, LinuxQuestions.Org, and Codetalker Digest. It was even featured in twelve movies, including The Matrix Reloaded, Die Hard 4, Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, and The Bourne Ultimatum.

### NSE

#### Search for Microsoft Security Bulletin
	locate ms17-010 | grep.nse$

#### Examine script
	nmap --script-help=smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse
	less /usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse
	
#### See which NSE category a script is in
	/categories <Enter>	// categories = {"vuln", "safe"}

#### Ways to run a script
	nmap -p 445 --script safe  
	nmap -p 445 --script smb-vuln-ms17-010  
	nmap -p 445 --script smb-vuln-ms17-010.nse

#### Run safe scripts
	nmap -p 445 --script safe -Pn -n -oA blue-safe-scripts 10.129.2.85

#### See all categories scripts can be in
    grep -r categories /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*.nse

#### Print NSE categories
    grep -r categories /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*.nse | grep -oP \".*?\" | sort -u

#### Run scripts whose categories are both vulnerable and safe.
	nmap -p 445 --script "vuln and safe" -Pn -n -oA blue-vuln-and-safe-scripts 10.129.2.85

### Additional TCP scans

#### ACK Scan (-sA)

	- Scan through an "established" filter on a router.  
	- Doesn't reliably tell us if a port is open or closed,  
	- but is useful for identifying hosts (network mapping).  
  
####  FIN Scan (-sF)

	- Set FIN bit of all scan packets.
  
#### Null Scan (-sN)

	- Set all control bits to 0.
  
#### Xmas Tree Scan (-sX)

	- Set FIN, PSH, URG, "lighting up the packet like a Christmas tree".
  
#### Maimon Scan (-sM)

	- Set FIN and ACK bits. Useful on some BSD-derived systems.


### IPv6

	nmap -Pn -sV -6 fe80::20c0 -e eth0 --packet-trace

	ping6 -I eth0 ff02::1	Multicast address for all link-local IPv6 nodes.
	ping6 -I eth0 ff02::2	Multicast address for all link-local IPv6 routers.


### Runtime interaction
	p		Turn on packet tracing.  
	v		Increase verbosity.  
	d		Increase debugging level.  
	Shift	Function inverted when pressing p, v, or d.
