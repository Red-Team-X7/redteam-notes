## Description

Native x86 powershell injection attacks on any Windows  platform.

Magic Unicorn is a simple tool for using a PowerShell downgrade attack and injecting shellcode into memory.

Usage is simple, just run Magic Unicorn (ensure Metasploit is installed if using Metasploit methods and in the right path) and magic unicorn will automatically generate a powershell command that you need to simply cut and paste the powershell code into a command line window or through a payload delivery system. Unicorn supports your own shellcode, cobalt strike, and Metasploit.
