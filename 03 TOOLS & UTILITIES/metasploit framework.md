## Description
Metasploit is a penetration testing platform that enables you to find, exploit, and validate vulnerabilities. It provides the infrastructure, content, and tools to perform penetration tests and extensive security auditing and thanks to the open source community and Rapid7â€™s own hard working content team, new modules are added on a regular basis, which means that the latest exploit is available to you as soon as itâ€™s published.
